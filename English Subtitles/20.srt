Mrs. Dieter had given Heidi to the Sesemann family.

25
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:29,450
Mr. Sesemann was on a trip and was represented by Mrs. Rottenmeier when Heidi
arrived.

26
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:34,450
Mrs. Rottenmeier was the housekeeper and was responsible for Clara's well-being,

27
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:37,450
Mr. Sesemann's crippled daughter.

28
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:41,450
Although Mrs. Rottenmeier herself had wanted a playmate for Clara,

29
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:45,450
she seemed to have been very disappointed by Heidi.

30
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:53,178
The End

31
00:01:53,178 --> 00:01:56,178
- Never! - Oh, yes, you have that.

32
00:01:56,178 --> 00:01:58,178
You're looking for a girl with a good character.

33
00:01:58,178 --> 00:02:02,178
She should be well-educated, not lie, understand quickly and waste Clara's time.

34
00:02:02,178 --> 00:02:04,178
And this description fits exactly on Heidi.

35
00:02:04,178 --> 00:02:09,178
You should deal with her better first, then you'll see that I'm right.

36
00:02:12,178 --> 00:02:15,178
I'm sorry, I have to go. My master is waiting for me.

37
00:02:15,178 --> 00:02:18,178
I'll come by in the next few days and see how she's doing.

38
00:02:19,178 --> 00:02:22,160
Do you understand to leave the house without the child?

39
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,160
Stop your mouth!

40
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,160
Dete! Dete!

41
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,160
Wait!

42
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,160
Oh dear!

43
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:39,770
Aunt Dete!

44
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,770
If Aunt Dede leaves, I won't know how to get home.

45
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,770
She forgot to tell me.

46
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,770
You don't have to go home anymore.

47
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,770
Yes, I want to go back tomorrow.

48
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,770
I envy you.

49
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,770
You're doing really well.

50
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:00,770
You can go anywhere you want.

51
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:03,770
Yes, but that's nothing special. Everyone can do that.

52
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:06,770
I don't understand that.

53
00:03:09,214 --> 00:03:11,214
My legs are paralyzed.

54
00:03:11,214 --> 00:03:13,214
How bad.

55
00:03:13,214 --> 00:03:15,214
Then you always have to sit in the chair with the wheels.

56
00:03:15,214 --> 00:03:17,214
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:17,214 --> 00:03:19,214
Do you want me to call you Adelheid?

58
00:03:19,214 --> 00:03:21,214
No, my name is Heidi.

59
00:03:21,214 --> 00:03:23,214
Aunt Dede invented Adelheid.

60
00:03:23,214 --> 00:03:25,214
Heidi suits you much better anyway.

61
00:03:25,214 --> 00:03:27,214
My name is Clara.

62
00:03:27,214 --> 00:03:29,214
But that's true.

63
00:03:29,214 --> 00:03:31,214
Your name suits you too.

64
00:03:31,214 --> 00:03:33,214
Good day, Heidi.

65
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:35,214
Nice to have you here.

66
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:37,214
Good day, Clara.

67
00:03:39,172 --> 00:03:45,172
Do you like it here in Frankfurt?

68
00:03:45,172 --> 00:03:46,172
No.

69
00:03:46,172 --> 00:03:48,172
Yes, but why not?

70
00:03:48,172 --> 00:03:50,172
Because I want to go back home to my grandfather.

71
00:03:50,172 --> 00:03:53,172
And if I can go, I'll take a lot of white rolls with me.

72
00:03:53,172 --> 00:03:55,172
Don't you like it here because of Fr. Rottenmeier?

73
00:03:55,172 --> 00:03:57,172
Oh, he didn't have to do anything for you.

74
00:03:57,172 --> 00:03:58,172
She's always like that.

75
00:03:58,172 --> 00:04:00,172
She can only scold.

76
00:04:00,172 --> 00:04:02,172
If you want, I can teach you how to read.

77
00:04:02,172 --> 00:04:04,172
It's not difficult at all.

78
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:10,278
I have many books that we can read. Maybe then everything is not so terribly
boring anymore.

79
00:04:10,278 --> 00:04:12,278
I can always sit down.

80
00:04:12,278 --> 00:04:15,278
You are the first girl that I see that can not read yet.

81
00:04:15,278 --> 00:04:19,278
I mean, you are at least eight years old, then everyone can do it.

82
00:04:19,278 --> 00:04:20,278
I do not.

83
00:04:20,278 --> 00:04:23,278
That's right, but that's not possible. Everyone has to learn to read at some
point.

84
00:04:23,278 --> 00:04:24,278
You too?

85
00:04:24,278 --> 00:04:30,278
No! What a terrible person! Just bring me this child into the house and then
disappear again.

86
00:04:32,278 --> 00:04:34,278
But I will not let that happen.

87
00:04:35,278 --> 00:04:37,278
I will not let that happen.

88
00:04:39,582 --> 00:04:41,582
Sebastian!

89
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:43,582
Yes?

90
00:04:43,582 --> 00:04:45,582
Is dinner ready?

91
00:04:45,582 --> 00:04:47,582
If I'm not mistaken, it's ready.

92
00:04:47,582 --> 00:04:50,582
Then please make sure Clara comes to dinner.

93
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,582
Yes, will be taken care of.

94
00:05:06,334 --> 00:05:09,334
Now tell me, do I have cream on the bake?

95
00:05:09,334 --> 00:05:11,334
You look exactly like my friend Peter.

96
00:05:11,334 --> 00:05:13,334
Do I have a doppelganger?

97
00:05:13,334 --> 00:05:14,334
Oh!

98
00:05:14,334 --> 00:05:15,334
Yes.

99
00:05:15,334 --> 00:05:18,334
I don't want you to get involved with the servants.

100
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:19,334
That's not part of it.

101
00:05:31,358 --> 00:05:35,358
Adelheid, what are you still waiting for? Please sit down.

102
00:05:47,358 --> 00:05:49,358
A whole head full of white bread!

103
00:05:49,358 --> 00:05:50,358
Adelheid!

104
00:05:50,526 --> 00:05:54,526
Don't you have any table manners at all?

105
00:05:54,526 --> 00:05:57,526
Since when do you climb on the table?

106
00:05:57,526 --> 00:05:59,526
You'll get a bun when you wake up.

107
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,526
I didn't want it for myself.

108
00:06:01,526 --> 00:06:04,526
I wanted to bring it to the grandmother.

109
00:06:04,526 --> 00:06:06,526
No, no, no, no apologies.

110
00:06:06,526 --> 00:06:11,526
Sit down properly and behave like a well-groomed little girl.

111
00:06:11,526 --> 00:06:13,526
What did I just deserve that for?

112
00:06:13,526 --> 00:06:16,526
In any case, you seem to have strange instincts.

113
00:06:16,526 --> 00:06:19,526
You're on the chair, my dear child.

114
00:06:19,526 --> 00:06:21,080
*sigh*

115
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:26,080
Thank you very much, Sebastian.

116
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,080
No need to thank me.

117
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:46,570
Grandmother, when you were little, did you also tie a bouquet of flowers?

118
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,570
Oh yes!

119
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,570
And what a beautiful one!

120
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:54,570
I'll hang the bouquet around the door and around the window.

121
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:57,570
Then it will look much more beautiful.

122
00:07:10,338 --> 00:07:12,338
No, I'd rather have that one.

123
00:07:15,338 --> 00:07:18,338
A white bun.

124
00:07:28,162 --> 00:07:30,162
Can I have some of that too?

125
00:07:30,162 --> 00:07:31,162
Yes.

126
00:07:35,162 --> 00:07:37,162
I've got a plate again.

127
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:45,162
Now have some water, Heidi, or the plate will fall off.

128
00:07:46,162 --> 00:07:47,162
Yes, thank you.

129
00:07:47,162 --> 00:07:49,162
Oh, that must be the cap.

130
00:07:52,162 --> 00:07:53,162
My dears.

131
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:57,666
It almost looks like you have to learn everything from the beginning.

132
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:00,666
You don't even seem to know the simplest rule of the table.

133
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:04,666
Number one: If you are served the meat, you lay it out like this.

134
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:07,666
Have you seen that now? It's very easy.

135
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:14,666
And then I noticed second that you talk too much with the staff.

136
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,666
Please just tell them if you want to have something from them.

137
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:20,666
They only use too much friendship. They need the strictness.

138
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:34,040
If you want something from Sebastian, just say "I want this and that" or "please
be so kind and bring me this and that" and no personal words, otherwise you do
nothing else than talk about it in the kitchen.

139
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:42,040
Let's come to Clara. Clara is being talked to by Miss Clara in this house, but
if she wants that in your case, she has to decide for herself.

140
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,040
Heidi should call me Clara.

141
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,040
Well, that would be regulated now.

142
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,040
Heidi should call me Peter.

143
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,040
Peter!

144
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,040
Oh, where am I?

145
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,870
Good morning, Grandfather!

146
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:13,870
Piep can fly!

147
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,662
We're already there!

148
00:09:14,662 --> 00:09:18,662
We brought something for you. The very first spring flower.

149
00:09:18,662 --> 00:09:20,662
That's very sweet. Give it to me.

150
00:09:20,662 --> 00:09:22,662
Smell it. It smells like spring.

151
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:25,662
Then the winter is finally over.

152
00:09:30,662 --> 00:09:34,662
Help! Be fast! Slow down!

153
00:09:34,662 --> 00:09:37,662
I want to, but I can't!

154
00:09:44,662 --> 00:09:47,662
I want to, but I can't!

155
00:09:51,662 --> 00:09:53,662
I want to, but I can't!

156
00:09:54,246 --> 00:09:56,246
Adelheid, do you even listen to me?

157
00:09:56,246 --> 00:09:58,246
Adelheid, answer me!

158
00:09:58,246 --> 00:10:00,246
I talked to you!

159
00:10:00,246 --> 00:10:02,246
Adelheid, answer me!

160
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:10,206
Don't you notice that she fell asleep?

161
00:10:10,206 --> 00:10:12,206
That can't be true!

162
00:10:12,206 --> 00:10:14,206
Oh, Snooki...

163
00:10:20,742 --> 00:10:22,742
Do you wish, madam?

164
00:10:22,742 --> 00:10:25,742
Bring this unheard child to bed immediately!

165
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:28,258
* Music *

166
00:10:50,018 --> 00:10:52,018
Beep, beep, beep, beep! Come!

167
00:10:56,258 --> 00:10:58,258
* Music *

168
00:11:02,258 --> 00:11:04,258
Ouch! Ouch!

169
00:11:06,118 --> 00:11:11,118
Where am I?

170
00:11:11,118 --> 00:11:16,118
Oh, in Frankfurt. What kind of room is that?

171
00:11:16,118 --> 00:11:35,974
Hm, still. So I was just dreaming.

172
00:11:35,974 --> 00:11:38,974
This room looks like a dark box.

173
00:11:44,934 --> 00:11:48,934
Behind that could be the window, but why are they hanging it up?

174
00:11:54,954 --> 00:12:01,954
I can do it!

175
00:12:08,522 --> 00:12:14,522
I want to see if the sun is shining and if the tannins are rustling in front of
the house.

176
00:12:38,522 --> 00:12:44,394
* Music *

177
00:12:44,394 --> 00:12:47,394
I have to see if it's raining today.

178
00:13:09,162 --> 00:13:11,162
Please come back home!

179
00:13:16,586 --> 00:13:18,586
Thanks for watching and see you in the next video!

180
00:13:23,158 --> 00:13:35,158
Snuggie, Joseph, Peter, Grandfather, I want to go home, where are you all?

181
00:13:35,158 --> 00:13:41,158
Bärli, Schwänli, Grandmother, Peter, get me, please come and get me!

182
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:48,158
Grandfather, Peter, I'm here!

183
00:13:48,158 --> 00:13:53,158
Catch me, I can't hold on anymore!

184
00:13:53,158 --> 00:13:57,158
Peter, Snuggie, wait!

185
00:14:13,158 --> 00:14:16,158
Ouch, my head!

186
00:14:16,586 --> 00:14:18,586
I'm not in the mountains.

187
00:14:27,586 --> 00:14:28,586
Disgust!

188
00:14:28,778 --> 00:14:30,778
Now she's sitting on the floor again.

189
00:14:30,778 --> 00:14:33,378
Don't you have enough chairs in the room?

190
00:14:33,378 --> 00:14:35,378
And didn't you hear me knocking?

191
00:14:36,378 --> 00:14:37,978
I knocked.

192
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:40,378
And when I knock, I expect an answer.

193
00:14:41,378 --> 00:14:42,378
Yes.

194
00:14:42,378 --> 00:14:43,778
Don't forget it again.

195
00:14:46,978 --> 00:14:48,178
And now get up.

196
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,578
Your breakfast is served.

197
00:14:49,578 --> 00:14:51,378
You're a little late today anyway.

198
00:14:51,378 --> 00:14:53,578
You seem to be a little hard of hearing, my child.

199
00:14:53,578 --> 00:14:55,578
I said you should get up.

200
00:14:56,436 --> 00:14:58,436
Adelheid, do you want to just stand there? I'll let you go.

201
00:14:58,436 --> 00:15:00,436
Adelheid, please show me some more obedience.

202
00:15:00,436 --> 00:15:02,436
What's wrong with you?

203
00:15:02,436 --> 00:15:04,436
Are you hard of hearing?

204
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:06,436
I told you to stand on your feet, Adelheid!

205
00:15:06,436 --> 00:15:08,436
Adelheid!

206
00:15:08,436 --> 00:15:10,436
I'm not Adelheid at all! I'm Heidi!

207
00:15:14,436 --> 00:15:16,436
Adelheid!

208
00:15:16,436 --> 00:15:18,436
Adelheid!

209
00:15:18,436 --> 00:15:20,436
Adelheid!

210
00:15:20,436 --> 00:15:22,436
Adelheid!

211
00:15:22,436 --> 00:15:24,436
Adelheid!

212
00:15:27,342 --> 00:15:32,342
Your baptismal name is nobility and for this reason I will also call you
nobility.

213
00:15:32,342 --> 00:15:33,342
Get used to it.

214
00:15:33,342 --> 00:15:35,342
But my name is Heidi now.

215
00:15:37,342 --> 00:15:38,342
That could suit you.

216
00:15:38,342 --> 00:15:39,342
And now come.

217
00:15:57,342 --> 00:15:57,902
Subtitles by Stephanie Geiges

218
00:15:57,902 --> 00:16:00,402
Adelheid, your teacher will be here at 10 o'clock.

219
00:16:00,402 --> 00:16:03,702
I hope that you will be in the study room on time and that you will behave well.

220
00:16:03,702 --> 00:16:06,602
Clara, I expect from you that you will not be distracted.

221
00:16:08,102 --> 00:16:10,402
I am very glad that you came, Heidi.

222
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,902
Now I am at least not alone as I used to be.

223
00:16:25,602 --> 00:16:26,254
Adelheid!

224
00:16:26,254 --> 00:16:27,254
Yes?

225
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:29,254
Please wait with Clara until the teacher comes.

226
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:31,254
But be kind and don't upset her.

227
00:16:31,254 --> 00:16:33,254
Clara is very sick.

228
00:16:37,254 --> 00:16:39,254
All the best.

229
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:45,510
What are you doing there at the window?

230
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,510
Do you want to climb out?

231
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,510
No, I just want to look out!

232
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:58,878
Didn't it hurt terribly?

233
00:16:58,878 --> 00:17:00,878
No, it didn't hurt at all.

234
00:17:01,878 --> 00:17:04,278
Where can I look out of this house?

235
00:17:04,278 --> 00:17:06,878
Are the windows closed or too high for me?

236
00:17:06,878 --> 00:17:09,078
Why do you want to look out?

237
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:11,278
I think I've never seen out of the window.

238
00:17:11,278 --> 00:17:14,278
Don't you want to know what's outside?

239
00:17:14,278 --> 00:17:16,278
Aren't you curious at all?

240
00:17:16,278 --> 00:17:18,278
I've never been outside in my life.

241
00:17:18,278 --> 00:17:20,678
I've been in this house since I was born.

242
00:17:20,678 --> 00:17:25,278
I don't even know what I should be curious about.

243
00:17:25,284 --> 00:17:27,284
Oh, no.

244
00:17:28,284 --> 00:17:32,284
I have an idea. Why don't you ask Sebastian? He knows for sure. He knows his way
around.

245
00:17:33,284 --> 00:17:36,284
Oh, yes, thank you. Sebastian looks like Peter. He knows for sure.

246
00:17:37,284 --> 00:17:39,284
But be careful that Mrs. Rottenmeier doesn't catch you.

247
00:17:40,284 --> 00:17:42,284
Yes, I'll do that.

248
00:17:54,194 --> 00:17:58,194
Sebastian! Sebastian, wait!

249
00:17:58,194 --> 00:18:01,194
Stay still, Sebastian!

250
00:18:05,194 --> 00:18:07,194
What can I do for you?

251
00:18:08,194 --> 00:18:10,194
Careful that Mr. Rottenmeier doesn't catch us!

252
00:18:10,194 --> 00:18:12,194
I would have missed that.

253
00:18:12,194 --> 00:18:14,194
I wish for this and that.

254
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:16,194
Could you do this and that for me?

255
00:18:16,194 --> 00:18:18,194
Yes, of course.

256
00:18:18,194 --> 00:18:20,194
But how am I supposed to understand that?

257
00:18:20,194 --> 00:18:22,072
Do you wish for this or that?

258
00:18:22,072 --> 00:18:27,572
Miss Rottenmeier said I should talk to you like this. And what Miss Rottenmeier
says, you have to do it too.

259
00:18:32,072 --> 00:18:36,272
Yes, I know, Miss Rottenmeier. And what am I supposed to do for you, little
Miss?

260
00:18:36,272 --> 00:18:41,472
Be careful! Please don't call me Miss all the time. My name is Heidi.

261
00:18:41,472 --> 00:18:47,372
Yes, I know. But Miss Rottenmeier said I should do it, and you can't do anything
about it.

262
00:18:47,372 --> 00:18:50,572
It doesn't matter either. I want to show you something up there.

263
00:18:52,072 --> 00:18:57,072
Yes, I know. But Miss Rottenmeier said I should do it, and you can't do anything
about it.

264
00:18:57,072 --> 00:19:00,072
I want to show you something up there.

265
00:19:00,242 --> 00:19:02,242
What are you doing here?

266
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:04,242
I'm going to the bathroom.

267
00:19:04,242 --> 00:19:06,242
What are you doing here?

268
00:19:06,242 --> 00:19:06,738
I'm going to the bathroom.

269
00:19:06,738 --> 00:19:08,738
A little moment, yes?

270
00:19:12,738 --> 00:19:14,738
Oh, thank you.

271
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,738
That's much better.

272
00:19:19,738 --> 00:19:22,738
Finally my window is open and I can see outside.

273
00:19:36,738 --> 00:19:39,738
To be continued...

274
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:42,530
But where are the flowers?

275
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,530
And where are the meadows and the fir trees?

276
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:46,530
You can't see anything at all.

277
00:19:59,122 --> 00:20:03,122
There are still houses and stones and streets here.

278
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:11,122
Heidi, are you satisfied? Can you move something?

279
00:20:14,122 --> 00:20:17,122
But Miss Clara, should I push it for you?

280
00:20:19,122 --> 00:20:21,122
Yes, good.

281
00:20:25,618 --> 00:20:29,618
Would you like to go back to your mountains?

282
00:20:30,618 --> 00:20:33,618
Do you love the mountains so much?

283
00:20:34,618 --> 00:20:36,618
Oh, so you can't do anything about it.

284
00:20:36,618 --> 00:20:42,618
I thought we could be friends, Heidi, but you can't stand it here in Frankfurt.

285
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:46,618
Should I tell Mr. Rottmeier to get your aunt?

286
00:20:46,618 --> 00:20:48,618
Yes, please do that.

287
00:20:48,618 --> 00:20:52,412
I think it's a shame. I like you. It would have been very funny...

288
00:20:52,412 --> 00:20:55,412
...if I hadn't been able to get along with the two of us.

289
00:20:55,412 --> 00:20:58,412
I like you too, but I think, you know...

290
00:20:58,412 --> 00:21:00,412
Then I'm alone again.

291
00:21:00,412 --> 00:21:03,412
Slowly I should have gotten used to it.

292
00:21:03,412 --> 00:21:05,412
When I was little, my mother died.

293
00:21:05,412 --> 00:21:08,412
And my father was on business trips all the time.

294
00:21:08,412 --> 00:21:11,412
It was always full of Rottnmeier for me, you know?

295
00:21:11,412 --> 00:21:14,412
It's so boring that I don't know how to stand it.

296
00:21:14,412 --> 00:21:16,412
Always full of Rottnmeier.

297
00:21:16,412 --> 00:21:19,412
I can't stand her eternal warmth anymore.

298
00:21:22,412 --> 00:21:25,412

299
00:21:28,438 --> 00:21:30,438
Clara, wait!

300
00:21:31,438 --> 00:21:33,438
I thought about everything again.

301
00:21:33,438 --> 00:21:34,438
I'll stay here.

302
00:21:34,438 --> 00:21:35,438
Yes?

303
00:21:35,438 --> 00:21:37,438
Yes, for at least a few more days.

304
00:21:40,438 --> 00:21:42,438
For sure?

305
00:21:42,438 --> 00:21:43,438
I'll stay here.

306
00:21:43,438 --> 00:21:48,438
When I'm already in Frankfurt, I have to find the presents that I want to bring
home to the others.

307
00:21:48,438 --> 00:21:53,438
Tobacco for the grandfather, a pipe for Peter and many white buns. A whole
suitcase full.

308
00:21:55,158 --> 00:21:58,158
Heidi, I'm so happy.

309
00:21:59,158 --> 00:22:04,158
Can you help me, Clara, that I get all the things when I want to go home?

310
00:22:04,158 --> 00:22:07,158
Yes, of course, I'll do that.

311
00:22:07,158 --> 00:22:09,158
Mrs. Clara!

312
00:22:09,158 --> 00:22:11,158
Heidemarie!

313
00:22:11,158 --> 00:22:13,158
Uh, Adelheid.

314
00:22:13,158 --> 00:22:16,158
Heidemarie is not bad either.

315
00:22:16,158 --> 00:22:18,158
I like Heidi better.

316
00:22:18,158 --> 00:22:20,158
Do you know how we can call her?

317
00:22:20,158 --> 00:22:21,158
No, how?

318
00:22:21,158 --> 00:22:23,158
We just call her Mrs. Warmth.

319
00:22:25,158 --> 00:22:26,166
Yes, we do.

320
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:31,166
He's been awake for half an hour. Oh, warm-up, my nerves can't stand it.

321
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:37,166
And this terrible child has messed it all up. And this noise. Discipline!

322
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:45,166
So Heidi had decided to stay in the Sesemann house.

323
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:48,166
She got along well with Clara, even with the schoolteacher,

324
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:51,166
if she only knew what he wanted from her.

325
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:55,084
At home in the mountains, she had never asked anyone about all the strange
things.

326
00:22:55,084 --> 00:22:58,764
Heidi found the life here in this house sometimes very strange.

327
00:22:58,764 --> 00:23:00,164
Everything was so difficult.

328
00:23:00,164 --> 00:23:02,524
They made the simplest things wrong.

329
00:23:02,524 --> 00:23:06,124
They locked birds in cages and were angry when they were released.

330
00:23:06,124 --> 00:23:09,204
And even a rottmeyer, who always knew everything,

331
00:23:09,204 --> 00:23:12,484
didn't want to see that birds fly better outside than inside.

332
00:23:12,484 --> 00:23:14,644
And then there was the thing with the mice.

333
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:16,284
After all, mice are hungry too.

334
00:23:16,284 --> 00:23:19,644
But we want to tell you about that in our next story.

335
00:23:20,514 --> 00:23:48,514
♪ Heidi, Heidi, your world are the mountains. Heidi, Heidi, because up here you
are at home. Heidi, Heidi, come home, find your happiness, come back home. ♪
