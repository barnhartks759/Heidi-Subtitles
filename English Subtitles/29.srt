1
00:00:04,462 --> 00:00:09,462
Holadio

2
00:00:12,462 --> 00:00:17,462
Holadio

3
00:00:20,462 --> 00:00:24,462
Heidi

4
00:00:24,462 --> 00:00:28,462
Your world are the mountains

5
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:32,462
Heidi

6
00:00:32,462 --> 00:00:36,462
Because up here you are at home

7
00:00:36,462 --> 00:00:40,462
Dark firs

8
00:00:40,462 --> 00:00:44,462
Green meadows in the sunshine

9
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:48,462
Heidi, Heidi

10
00:00:48,462 --> 00:00:52,462
You need to be happy

11
00:00:52,462 --> 00:01:00,462
Holadio

12
00:01:00,462 --> 00:01:02,462
Holadio

13
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:05,462
Holadio

14
00:01:05,462 --> 00:01:09,462
Heidi, Heidi

15
00:01:09,462 --> 00:01:11,462
Come home

16
00:01:11,462 --> 00:01:13,462
Find your happiness

17
00:01:13,462 --> 00:01:18,462
Come back home

18
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,462
Klara, look! A butterfly!

19
00:01:29,462 --> 00:01:31,462
It's flying!

20
00:01:32,462 --> 00:01:33,462
Did you see it?

21
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,530
Yes, he is beautiful, Heidi.

22
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,530
Will you bring him to me?

23
00:01:42,906 --> 00:01:48,346
Wait, Butterfly! I'll catch you!

24
00:01:49,358 --> 00:01:50,358
Ouch!

25
00:01:53,358 --> 00:01:54,358
Are you from the city?

26
00:01:54,358 --> 00:01:55,358
Yes!

27
00:01:56,358 --> 00:01:57,358
That's why we're marking you!

28
00:01:57,358 --> 00:01:58,358
And how!

29
00:01:59,358 --> 00:02:02,358
If you thought you could do it better, then go ahead!

30
00:02:03,358 --> 00:02:04,358
Come on!

31
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:05,358
Let's go!

32
00:02:08,358 --> 00:02:10,358
Don't be so rude!

33
00:02:10,358 --> 00:02:12,358
You can't just stand on your feet like that!

34
00:02:12,358 --> 00:02:14,358
He flew over there!

35
00:02:18,358 --> 00:02:19,358
I caught him!

36
00:02:25,358 --> 00:02:26,358
Now I'll catch him!

37
00:02:26,358 --> 00:02:27,358
Careful!

38
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,358
But be careful with him!

39
00:02:31,358 --> 00:02:32,358
Don't hurt him!

40
00:02:32,358 --> 00:02:34,358
Butterflies have sensitive wings!

41
00:02:35,358 --> 00:02:36,358
There?

42
00:02:36,358 --> 00:02:37,358
No!

43
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:38,358
No!

44
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:39,358
Over there!

45
00:02:43,358 --> 00:02:44,358
Hang on!

46
00:02:44,358 --> 00:02:45,358
I'll catch him!

47
00:02:50,358 --> 00:02:51,358
Now!

48
00:02:52,358 --> 00:02:54,358
Oh, nothing again!

49
00:02:54,358 --> 00:02:56,358
Don't worry, I can save you!

50
00:02:56,358 --> 00:02:57,358
I can catch him!

51
00:02:57,358 --> 00:02:58,358
I'll catch him!

52
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:16,038
We did it! We did it! We got the butterfly!

53
00:03:16,092 --> 00:03:18,092
There you have it.

54
00:03:18,092 --> 00:03:20,092
Thank you.

55
00:03:20,092 --> 00:03:22,092
I've never seen you here before.

56
00:03:22,092 --> 00:03:24,092
We're only here this afternoon.

57
00:03:24,092 --> 00:03:26,092
But you must be quite rich.

58
00:03:26,092 --> 00:03:28,092
I saw how you arrived.

59
00:03:28,092 --> 00:03:30,092
You rarely see such a big carriage here.

60
00:03:30,092 --> 00:03:32,092
It doesn't belong to me.

61
00:03:32,092 --> 00:03:34,092
The carriage belongs to Clara's father.

62
00:03:36,092 --> 00:03:38,092
Why is she sitting in the wheelchair?

63
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:40,092
What's wrong with her?

64
00:03:40,092 --> 00:03:42,092
Clara can't walk.

65
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:48,092
Clara!

66
00:03:48,092 --> 00:03:50,092
We caught the butterfly.

67
00:03:50,092 --> 00:03:52,092
The two boys helped us.

68
00:03:57,052 --> 00:03:58,812
Come on, Klaus, let's go.

69
00:03:58,812 --> 00:03:59,812
Goodbye.

70
00:03:59,812 --> 00:04:00,812
It's okay.

71
00:04:00,812 --> 00:04:01,812
Goodbye, girl.

72
00:04:01,812 --> 00:04:02,812
Maybe we'll see you again.

73
00:04:02,812 --> 00:04:03,812
Goodbye.

74
00:04:03,812 --> 00:04:04,812
Klara!

75
00:04:04,812 --> 00:04:05,812
It's a pretty butterfly.

76
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:06,812
You'll like it too.

77
00:04:06,812 --> 00:04:07,812
I have it in my hands here.

78
00:04:07,812 --> 00:04:08,812
Now I don't want to see it anymore.

79
00:04:08,812 --> 00:04:09,812
But why all of a sudden?

80
00:04:09,812 --> 00:04:10,812
The two boys and I have put so much effort into it.

81
00:04:10,812 --> 00:04:11,812
That's what it is.

82
00:04:11,812 --> 00:04:12,812
You have put so much effort into it and I have to sit here in this stupid
wheelchair.

83
00:04:12,812 --> 00:04:13,812
Now you're sad.

84
00:04:13,812 --> 00:04:14,812
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:14,812 --> 00:04:15,812
I'm sorry.

86
00:04:15,812 --> 00:04:16,812
I'm sorry.

87
00:04:16,812 --> 00:04:17,812
I'm sorry.

88
00:04:17,812 --> 00:04:18,812
I'm sorry.

89
00:04:18,812 --> 00:04:19,812
I'm sorry.

90
00:04:19,812 --> 00:04:20,812
I'm sorry.

91
00:04:20,812 --> 00:04:21,812
I'm sorry.

92
00:04:21,812 --> 00:04:22,812
I'm sorry.

93
00:04:22,812 --> 00:04:23,812
I'm sorry.

94
00:04:23,812 --> 00:04:24,812
I'm sorry.

95
00:04:24,812 --> 00:04:25,812
I'm sorry.

96
00:04:25,812 --> 00:04:26,802
I'm sorry.

97
00:04:26,802 --> 00:04:44,802
You walked around with the two boys and you forgot me here. I know that it's
more fun than sitting here with me. I find it boring too. But you could have
come over to me. After all, I can't come to you.

98
00:04:48,924 --> 00:04:50,924
But Clara...

99
00:04:57,924 --> 00:05:01,924
I'm sorry Clara, but I thought you wanted to see the butterfly.

100
00:05:01,924 --> 00:05:04,924
I know. It wasn't right what I said.

101
00:05:04,924 --> 00:05:07,924
What can you do about me being sick?

102
00:05:07,924 --> 00:05:08,924
Clara...

103
00:05:08,924 --> 00:05:10,924
No, let me go. I want to be alone.

104
00:05:10,924 --> 00:05:14,924
I was alone all my life. Go and play with the other children.

105
00:05:14,924 --> 00:05:16,924
But Clara...

106
00:05:17,634 --> 00:05:19,634
What is it?

107
00:05:19,634 --> 00:05:23,634
Children, children, where have you been so long?

108
00:05:23,634 --> 00:05:26,634
We have already prepared the food.

109
00:05:26,634 --> 00:05:29,634
Oh, isn't it wonderful out here?

110
00:05:29,634 --> 00:05:31,634
There are greens and flowers everywhere.

111
00:05:31,634 --> 00:05:33,634
And there are flowers in all colors.

112
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:35,634
Clara, look!

113
00:05:37,634 --> 00:05:39,548
Clara?

114
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:43,788
Oh, tell me, my dear, are these tears?

115
00:05:43,788 --> 00:05:46,268
We would cry on such a beautiful day.

116
00:05:46,268 --> 00:05:48,348
Grandmother, please tell Mrs. Rottenmeier

117
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,468
she should send Heidi back home to the mountains.

118
00:05:50,468 --> 00:05:53,828
Oh, but child!

119
00:05:53,828 --> 00:05:56,348
I don't want to see her anymore. She should go.

120
00:05:56,348 --> 00:05:59,748
I'm afraid I just don't know what you mean.

121
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,870
I know what she's thinking, Grandmother.

122
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:05,870
I ran away with two strangers because I wanted to catch a butterfly for her.

123
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,870
And I left her alone.

124
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,870
I've done everything wrong again.

125
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,870
And that's supposed to be all that Heidi has done wrong?

126
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,870
What kind of child are you?

127
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,870
I don't care. I want to go home anyway.

128
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,870
Johan is supposed to finish the cart.

129
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,870
But we just arrived here.

130
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,870
You want to go home so quickly?

131
00:06:25,892 --> 00:06:27,392
Do you mean that seriously?

132
00:06:27,392 --> 00:06:28,892
Yes, I mean that seriously.

133
00:06:28,892 --> 00:06:30,192
What a pity for you.

134
00:06:30,192 --> 00:06:31,892
We can't go yet.

135
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,892
And do you know why? I don't feel like it.

136
00:06:33,892 --> 00:06:35,692
And you? Do you want to go home already?

137
00:06:35,692 --> 00:06:37,592
I'd like to stay.

138
00:06:37,592 --> 00:06:39,092
But if Clara really wants to...

139
00:06:39,092 --> 00:06:42,592
Ah, so you like the city with Miss Rottenmeier better.

140
00:06:42,592 --> 00:06:44,692
You'd rather do homework.

141
00:06:44,692 --> 00:06:46,192
I understand.

142
00:06:48,892 --> 00:06:51,392
We have strawberry jam with us.

143
00:06:53,822 --> 00:06:57,822
If Clara really wants to go home, then I want to too.

144
00:06:57,822 --> 00:06:58,822
That's better.

145
00:06:58,822 --> 00:06:59,822
You think?

146
00:06:59,822 --> 00:07:01,822
I'll tell Johann. He's supposed to tie the horses.

147
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:02,822
Heidi, but...

148
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:04,822
So, and now to you.

149
00:07:04,822 --> 00:07:06,822
You want us to send Heidi away.

150
00:07:06,822 --> 00:07:08,822
So you want to be alone again.

151
00:07:10,822 --> 00:07:12,822
So she's equal to you all of a sudden.

152
00:07:14,822 --> 00:07:17,822
And I always thought you loved her.

153
00:07:18,822 --> 00:07:20,822
Heidi...

154
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,710
Heidi, come back!

155
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,710
Leave it with the cart. I'd like to stay here.

156
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,710
Or do you not want to anymore?

157
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,710
Come here to me, Heidi.

158
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,710
Clara noticed that everything was nonsense.

159
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,710
Yes? Did she?

160
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,710
Now say something nice to her, Clara.

161
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,710
She is such a sweet little thing and I really like her.

162
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,710
Should I catch another butterfly?

163
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,564
No.

164
00:07:52,564 --> 00:07:56,964
Then all the problems seem to be solved now. Except for one, of course, the most
important thing.

165
00:07:56,964 --> 00:07:59,764
I wonder all the time if you've never been hungry.

166
00:08:01,364 --> 00:08:02,464
That looks pretty.

167
00:08:02,464 --> 00:08:03,964
You think I like something like that?

168
00:08:04,564 --> 00:08:05,764
You like it very much.

169
00:08:07,364 --> 00:08:08,964
May I take the flower pot with me?

170
00:08:11,964 --> 00:08:12,764
Clara!

171
00:08:15,326 --> 00:08:17,326
Oh, a butterfly, Clara.

172
00:08:17,326 --> 00:08:19,326
Psst, I'll catch it for you.

173
00:08:19,326 --> 00:08:21,326
Then you can see it clearly.

174
00:08:21,326 --> 00:08:23,326
No, Heidi, please let it sit there. It looks like a loop.

175
00:08:23,326 --> 00:08:25,326
A living one.

176
00:08:25,326 --> 00:08:27,326
Come here, loop.

177
00:08:27,326 --> 00:08:29,326
It's like flying to its friend.

178
00:08:33,326 --> 00:08:35,326
Goodbye, butterfly.

179
00:08:35,326 --> 00:08:37,326
Now there are even three butterflies.

180
00:08:45,326 --> 00:08:47,326
The end

181
00:08:51,454 --> 00:08:54,454
Where have you been all this time, Heidi?

182
00:08:54,454 --> 00:08:56,454
On a hill.

183
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:00,454
There, a squirrel.

184
00:09:00,454 --> 00:09:03,454
Squirrels are also in our mountains.

185
00:09:03,454 --> 00:09:05,454
Exciting.

186
00:09:07,454 --> 00:09:09,454
Hurry up, but don't run into a tree.

187
00:09:09,454 --> 00:09:11,454
I'm trying.

188
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:20,024
Where did it hide? I can't see it anymore.

189
00:09:20,024 --> 00:09:22,024
Up there on the big branch, look!

190
00:09:24,024 --> 00:09:26,024
Come on, little squirrel, come!

191
00:09:31,024 --> 00:09:32,024
Bravo!

192
00:09:33,024 --> 00:09:36,024
Clara! Heidi!

193
00:09:37,024 --> 00:09:39,024
Where are you children?

194
00:09:39,024 --> 00:09:41,952
Heidi! Clara!

195
00:09:41,952 --> 00:09:43,952
Come on, let's hide!

196
00:09:43,952 --> 00:09:45,952
Quiet!

197
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,952
Kids!

198
00:09:47,952 --> 00:09:49,952
Little children!

199
00:09:49,952 --> 00:09:51,952
Where are you?

200
00:09:57,952 --> 00:09:59,952
Little children!

201
00:09:59,952 --> 00:10:01,952
Clara!

202
00:10:01,952 --> 00:10:03,952
Heidi!

203
00:10:03,952 --> 00:10:05,952
We have to go on, or they'll find us!

204
00:10:05,952 --> 00:10:07,952
Quiet!

205
00:10:07,952 --> 00:10:09,952
Oh, where did the children go?

206
00:10:09,952 --> 00:10:11,952
They were just here somewhere.

207
00:10:12,032 --> 00:10:13,032
Hello!

208
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:16,032
Heidi!

209
00:10:17,032 --> 00:10:18,032
Clara!

210
00:10:18,032 --> 00:10:19,032
Look at you!

211
00:10:19,032 --> 00:10:20,032
Cuckoo!

212
00:10:21,472 --> 00:10:23,272
The earthworm has hidden her.

213
00:10:23,272 --> 00:10:24,972
The poor children have disappeared.

214
00:10:24,972 --> 00:10:27,472
How can I help it, Miss Rottenmeier?

215
00:10:27,472 --> 00:10:29,472
The poor little ones.

216
00:10:34,472 --> 00:10:36,224
That's too bad for me.

217
00:10:36,224 --> 00:10:39,224
I can never forgive myself for what has to happen.

218
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:46,224
What are you going to do? And where are you going to find food?

219
00:10:48,896 --> 00:10:55,896
Grandmother, there we are. Please don't cry.

220
00:11:01,896 --> 00:11:04,896
Edge, you fell in. I'm smarter.

221
00:11:04,896 --> 00:11:06,896
She did something to us.

222
00:11:06,896 --> 00:11:09,896
You're mean, Grandmother. I thought you were crying.

223
00:11:09,896 --> 00:11:12,896
Why am I mean? You two also wanted to put me in.

224
00:11:12,896 --> 00:11:14,896
Or is that not true?

225
00:11:18,896 --> 00:11:21,896
I don't know.

226
00:11:22,144 --> 00:11:24,144
I'd like to go for a ride.

227
00:11:24,972 --> 00:11:27,432
Let's go.

228
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,372
Hello.

229
00:11:32,812 --> 00:11:34,212
Hello.

230
00:11:39,212 --> 00:11:43,172
John had to hurry to pick us up.

231
00:11:49,952 --> 00:11:51,212
Heidi, over there.

232
00:11:51,392 --> 00:11:52,532
Where?

233
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,732
There are cows.

234
00:11:54,972 --> 00:11:56,972
Come in!

235
00:12:02,242 --> 00:12:05,242
And over there are even they.

236
00:12:07,242 --> 00:12:09,242
Do they look like yours?

237
00:12:09,242 --> 00:12:11,242
Yes, exactly the same.

238
00:12:15,242 --> 00:12:18,242
Grandmother, may I go to them?

239
00:12:32,242 --> 00:12:34,242
Yes, of course.

240
00:12:38,562 --> 00:12:41,962
I've never seen Heidi so happy before, Grandmother.

241
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:44,962
Do you want to stand still? Stay here!

242
00:12:46,362 --> 00:12:49,162
Oh, Sebastian, please prepare tea and cake for us.

243
00:12:49,162 --> 00:12:49,962
Right away.

244
00:12:49,962 --> 00:12:51,962
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you!

245
00:12:51,962 --> 00:12:53,562
What are you doing with my goat?

246
00:12:53,562 --> 00:12:56,562
Don't chase my goat around like that, it shouldn't lose weight.

247
00:12:56,562 --> 00:12:58,562
We just played a little bit.

248
00:12:58,568 --> 00:13:01,768
If you want to play, then buy a parrot, but leave my goat alone.

249
00:13:01,768 --> 00:13:04,668
The child didn't mean it badly, but may I ask you something?

250
00:13:04,668 --> 00:13:08,168
Would you give the two children a sip of goat's milk afterwards?

251
00:13:08,168 --> 00:13:08,868
Me?

252
00:13:08,868 --> 00:13:13,168
Of course, you shouldn't do that for free, but our Clara has never drunk goat's
milk before.

253
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:15,668
From me, if you really want to.

254
00:13:15,668 --> 00:13:17,068
A gold piece.

255
00:13:17,068 --> 00:13:19,668
You could take the goat with you to one of them.

256
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:22,868
That's unbelievable.

257
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:24,868
There's actually milk coming out of it.

258
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:30,490
Gail, you're amazed. You've never seen that before.

259
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,490
May I? I'd like to milk her.

260
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,490
You couldn't do that.

261
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,490
I think I can.

262
00:13:40,898 --> 00:13:42,898
Well, the world hasn't seen that yet.

263
00:13:42,898 --> 00:13:45,898
You even do that better than me, little one.

264
00:13:45,898 --> 00:13:47,898
That's hard to believe.

265
00:13:49,898 --> 00:13:53,898
Heidi, how can you do that? Just as well as the farmer's wife.

266
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,310
Huh?

267
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:29,618
I told you, eating is boring.

268
00:14:31,618 --> 00:14:34,618
You actually ate more this afternoon than Heidi.

269
00:14:34,618 --> 00:14:37,618
But I've never been as hungry as I am today.

270
00:14:37,618 --> 00:14:38,618
Yes, I know.

271
00:14:38,618 --> 00:14:43,618
Fresh air and sunshine even make a beep as if you were hungry like a bear.

272
00:14:47,618 --> 00:14:48,618
It tastes so good.

273
00:14:48,618 --> 00:14:52,618
HAPPY HALLOWEEN

274
00:14:52,618 --> 00:14:56,618
High on the yellow hill

275
00:14:56,618 --> 00:14:59,618
I sit at my brother-in-law's.

276
00:15:00,164 --> 00:15:03,164
Where did the fox go?

277
00:15:03,216 --> 00:15:08,216
The fox went to the grave, the sun glistens in a funny way.

278
00:15:09,216 --> 00:15:12,216
Forests, meadows and meadows,

279
00:15:13,216 --> 00:15:16,216
shining gold of the earth.

280
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:21,216
I would like to see

281
00:15:22,216 --> 00:15:26,216
above the rolling waves.

282
00:15:27,216 --> 00:15:31,216
I would like to see

283
00:15:31,216 --> 00:15:34,216
above the rolling waves.

284
00:16:01,216 --> 00:16:04,216
I would like to see

285
00:16:05,188 --> 00:16:07,188
Good evening, Mrs. Sesemann.

286
00:16:07,188 --> 00:16:09,188
You're back later than I thought.

287
00:16:09,188 --> 00:16:11,188
At least we're back.

288
00:16:11,188 --> 00:16:14,188
Miss Clara, as I can see, you're tired.

289
00:16:14,188 --> 00:16:18,148
Miss Clara, what's wrong with you? Wake up!

290
00:16:18,148 --> 00:16:23,748
Mrs. Rottenmeier, please don't wake the children up, they are tired.

291
00:16:23,748 --> 00:16:25,748
The day was nice, but long.

292
00:16:25,748 --> 00:16:28,748
Aha, then Mrs. Klarau has over-exhausted herself.

293
00:16:28,748 --> 00:16:32,348
Oh, what, don't get so excited all the time.

294
00:16:32,348 --> 00:16:35,548
Sunlight and fresh air make you tired.

295
00:16:35,548 --> 00:16:37,548
It was fun.

296
00:16:37,548 --> 00:16:39,548
Just look, like the angels.

297
00:16:41,948 --> 00:16:44,348
Put the children in, Sebastian, but be quiet.

298
00:16:44,348 --> 00:16:45,948
Please don't wake them up, okay?

299
00:16:45,948 --> 00:16:48,348
Yes, madam, I will try my best.

300
00:16:50,564 --> 00:16:52,564
Something's not right.

301
00:16:52,564 --> 00:16:53,564
What is it, Sebastian?

302
00:16:53,564 --> 00:16:55,564
Is something wrong with her?

303
00:16:55,564 --> 00:16:56,564
She feels so hot.

304
00:16:56,564 --> 00:16:57,564
Oh, that too.

305
00:16:57,564 --> 00:16:59,564
Does she have a fever?

306
00:17:01,564 --> 00:17:02,564
Very hot.

307
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:05,564
Clara, child, what's wrong with you? Do you have a fever?

308
00:17:05,564 --> 00:17:06,564
It looks like it.

309
00:17:06,564 --> 00:17:09,564
Johann, go straight to the city and inform the house doctor.

310
00:17:09,564 --> 00:17:11,564
Hopefully he's at home.

311
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:14,564
Adelheid, wake up and come in!

312
00:17:18,948 --> 00:17:20,948
Are we home again?

313
00:17:20,948 --> 00:17:22,948
Yes, we have arrived.

314
00:17:22,948 --> 00:17:24,948
Get up quickly, child. I have to get the doctor.

315
00:17:24,948 --> 00:17:26,948
Is someone sick?

316
00:17:26,948 --> 00:17:28,948
I think it's Miss Clara. She feels very hot.

317
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:30,948
What? Clara is sick?

318
00:17:34,756 --> 00:17:38,156
I will not allow her to stay in this house any longer.

319
00:17:38,156 --> 00:17:40,956
Since she's been here, Clara has completely changed.

320
00:17:40,956 --> 00:17:44,556
She would never have thought of going to the countryside.

321
00:17:44,556 --> 00:17:46,156
It can't go on like this.

322
00:17:46,156 --> 00:17:49,756
No matter what I say in this house, it's just not followed.

323
00:17:49,756 --> 00:17:52,356
Just look at how pale she is.

324
00:17:52,356 --> 00:17:54,956
Was that really necessary?

325
00:17:54,956 --> 00:17:57,356
Clara is not like other children.

326
00:17:57,356 --> 00:17:59,156
She is sick and weak.

327
00:17:59,156 --> 00:18:03,956
And the worst thing is that it was all your idea, Mrs. Sesemann.

328
00:18:03,996 --> 00:18:07,796
Oh, I really would have expected something more sensible from you.

329
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:12,796
But this Heidi has turned your heads with all her nonsense about the mountains.

330
00:18:15,796 --> 00:18:19,796
It's okay, Mrs. Rottenmeier. We'll continue talking when we're alone.

331
00:18:27,686 --> 00:18:31,186
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm probably to blame for that, too.

332
00:18:31,186 --> 00:18:35,186
I always do everything wrong. That's always the case.

333
00:18:35,186 --> 00:18:38,186
And I thought you were having fun in the forest.

334
00:18:38,186 --> 00:18:41,186
Maybe you got sick because I left you alone.

335
00:18:44,686 --> 00:18:47,186
Oh, you're Clara's doctor?

336
00:18:47,186 --> 00:18:50,186
Ah, look at that. That's the little lady from Brunnen.

337
00:18:50,186 --> 00:18:52,186
Where did you leave your beautiful stick?

338
00:18:52,186 --> 00:18:54,186
Mr. Secret Service, please.

339
00:18:54,686 --> 00:18:56,186
Mr. Secret Service?

340
00:18:56,828 --> 00:19:02,828
Make Clara healthy. It's all my fault. I made her sick.

341
00:19:02,828 --> 00:19:04,828
Why did you do that?

342
00:19:04,828 --> 00:19:08,828
I wanted to go to the forest and then I left her there alone.

343
00:19:08,828 --> 00:19:11,828
I wanted to catch a butterfly.

344
00:19:11,828 --> 00:19:16,828
I don't think it's your fault, little girl. Leave it to me.

345
00:19:16,828 --> 00:19:20,828
I'll see what I can do.

346
00:19:20,828 --> 00:19:24,828
Please make her healthy again, okay?

347
00:19:26,828 --> 00:19:30,828
I'll see what I can do.

348
00:19:34,918 --> 00:19:38,918
Heidi, what are you doing here, my child?

349
00:19:39,918 --> 00:19:41,918
Grandmother, I'm scared.

350
00:19:41,918 --> 00:19:42,918
Heidi.

351
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:46,918
Poor little thing.

352
00:19:46,918 --> 00:19:48,918
Why are you so worried?

353
00:19:50,918 --> 00:19:52,918
Everything will be fine again.

354
00:19:52,918 --> 00:19:54,918
Your Clara only has a little fever.

355
00:19:54,918 --> 00:19:56,918
But maybe she's really sick.

356
00:19:56,918 --> 00:19:58,918
And then I'm to blame.

357
00:19:58,918 --> 00:20:01,918
No, Heidi. If someone is to blame, then I am.

358
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:05,980
Can I at least do something for her? I would like to help.

359
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,980
The Secret Service will help you.

360
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,980
And if he doesn't help?

361
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:16,980
Now calm down. He knows Clara from the beginning.

362
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,980
He knows what he has to do.

363
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:22,980
You will see, Heidi. Everything will look completely different tomorrow.

364
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,980
So I don't have to be afraid?

365
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,980
Yes, you can be very calm.

366
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:30,980
How are you?

367
00:20:31,084 --> 00:20:33,884
How are you, little lady? Very well.

368
00:20:33,884 --> 00:20:36,484
The fever will go away soon. She just has to sleep.

369
00:20:36,484 --> 00:20:38,484
Oh, how nice.

370
00:20:38,484 --> 00:20:40,484
And now go to her quickly.

371
00:20:40,484 --> 00:20:43,284
She just told me that she wants to see you.

372
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:45,284
Yes, good.

373
00:20:50,284 --> 00:20:51,284
Clara!

374
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:52,284
Psst!

375
00:20:52,614 --> 00:20:55,214
Yes, how nice that you came.

376
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:57,854
But just one moment, if I may remember.

377
00:20:57,854 --> 00:21:00,574
The doctor has explicitly said that you should sleep.

378
00:21:00,574 --> 00:21:03,934
Would you please leave us alone, Miss Rottenmeier?

379
00:21:03,934 --> 00:21:07,614
Would you please repeat that again?

380
00:21:07,614 --> 00:21:09,014
Gladly, if you want.

381
00:21:09,014 --> 00:21:11,894
Would you please leave us alone, Miss Rottenmeier?

382
00:21:11,894 --> 00:21:15,774
Yes, I understood that too.

383
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,054
As you wish, Miss Clara.

384
00:21:18,078 --> 00:21:23,078
In this house, there's been no value for good education for some time now.

385
00:21:23,078 --> 00:21:24,078
Why?

386
00:21:29,064 --> 00:21:30,664
Now she's outside.

387
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:31,664
Come closer.

388
00:21:31,664 --> 00:21:33,664
Doesn't that make you tired?

389
00:21:34,464 --> 00:21:36,464
Not at all.

390
00:21:42,312 --> 00:21:46,312
I was mean to you.

391
00:21:46,312 --> 00:21:50,312
I'm sorry, Heidi. Please don't go away from here.

392
00:21:50,312 --> 00:21:51,312
But Clara...

393
00:21:51,312 --> 00:21:57,312
I didn't mean it like that. I really like you. Please stay with me.

394
00:21:57,312 --> 00:21:59,312
But Clara...

395
00:21:59,312 --> 00:22:02,312
Since you're here, everything is much nicer.

396
00:22:02,312 --> 00:22:06,312
I used to be alone all day and now I have a sister.

397
00:22:06,312 --> 00:22:08,312
I like you too, Clara.

398
00:22:08,312 --> 00:22:11,230
I liked it so much in your forest.

399
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,630
Let's go there again when I'm healthy. Let's go there again when I'm healthy.

400
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,430
Mhm, if you want to. Mhm, if you want to.

401
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:18,330
And Johann will take us there every day. And Johann will take us there every
day.

402
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:20,230
That's nice. That's nice.

403
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,230
I think so too. I think so too.

404
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:26,730
Then we'll catch butterflies. Then we'll catch butterflies.

405
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:33,030
And so a day full of excitement and adventure came to an end.

406
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:36,030
The two girls thought about this afternoon for a long time.

407
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,454
They often talked about it. They often talked about it.

408
00:22:37,454 --> 00:22:49,344
Catching butterflies, going on a boat trip, milking goats and the fact that they
became friends on this day. 捕獲蜜蜜蜂 捕獲蜜蜂 捕獲蜜蜂 捕獲蜜蜂 捕獲蜜蜂 捕獲蜂 捕獲蜂 捕獲蜂 捕獲蜂 捕獲蜂 捕獲蜂
捕獲蜂 捕獲蜂 捕獲蜂 捕獲蜂

409
00:22:49,352 --> 00:22:54,352
Just as fast as Heidi hoped, Clara did not get well.

410
00:22:54,352 --> 00:22:57,352
The Secret Service came almost every day and looked after her.

411
00:22:57,352 --> 00:23:01,352
And Mrs. Rottenmeier finally got a reason to cheer herself up.

412
00:23:01,352 --> 00:23:07,352
It was not so great for Johan either, when Heidi asked him to help her one day.

413
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:09,998
Heidi had a plan.

414
00:23:09,998 --> 00:23:19,998
She wanted to make Clara happy, and that's why she went out to the countryside
on her own. She looked for her two friends and together they got something for
Clara.

415
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:27,998
What that was, that should still be a secret, because we want to tell you about
it in the next story.

416
00:23:28,404 --> 00:23:36,404
Heidi, Heidi, your world are the mountains.

417
00:23:36,404 --> 00:23:44,404
Heidi, Heidi, because up here you are at home.

418
00:23:44,404 --> 00:23:57,404
Heidi, Heidi, come home, find your happiness, come back home.

419
00:23:58,404 --> 00:23:59,760
To be continued
