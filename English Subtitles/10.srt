00:01:22,042 --> 00:01:29,042
Heidi dreamed every night of her visit to DÃ¶rfli, and every morning she woke up,
she was looking forward to it.

2
00:01:39,194 --> 00:01:42,194
Good morning Heidi, did you fall out of your bed this morning?

3
00:01:43,194 --> 00:01:45,194
When are we leaving?

4
00:01:46,194 --> 00:01:48,194
I don't know what you mean, where do you want to go?

5
00:01:49,194 --> 00:01:52,194
You don't know anymore? We're going down into the valley today.

6
00:01:53,194 --> 00:01:56,194
Today? That's way too dangerous.

7
00:02:16,346 --> 00:02:20,846
It was snowing and snowing, every day and every night.

8
00:02:20,846 --> 00:02:23,346
Heidi became more and more impatient.

9
00:02:23,346 --> 00:02:26,846
She tried to spend the time with all kinds of work.

10
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:29,846
She still fed her deer every day.

11
00:02:29,846 --> 00:02:32,346
But she was only half-hearted.

12
00:02:32,346 --> 00:02:35,346
Heidi finally wanted to go down into the valley.

13
00:02:35,346 --> 00:02:39,346
Still? It will never stop.

14
00:02:39,346 --> 00:02:42,346
Snow, snow, snow.

15
00:02:42,346 --> 00:02:45,346
At some point it will stop again.

16
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:56,706
And then it was finally time. The heavy snow clouds disappeared.

17
00:02:56,706 --> 00:03:02,706
The sky was again as blue as Heidi knew it from the summer and the sun glittered
on the ice.

18
00:03:02,706 --> 00:03:05,706
Finally! It's not snowing anymore!

19
00:03:08,706 --> 00:03:10,706
It's clear again!

20
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:22,659
Come on, Grandfather, come with me!

21
00:03:28,967 --> 00:03:32,967
- Are we going down here? - No, Hattie, not today, maybe tomorrow.

22
00:03:32,967 --> 00:03:37,967
But you said yourself, if it stops snowing, then we can go.

23
00:03:38,967 --> 00:03:43,891
We would sink to the ice in the snow, it is still much too loose and much too
high.

24
00:04:11,975 --> 00:04:14,475
I have eaten everything, except for the last crumb.

25
00:04:14,475 --> 00:04:15,975
Then we can go now.

26
00:04:16,975 --> 00:04:18,475
Where do we want to go?

27
00:04:18,475 --> 00:04:19,975
You have to go three times.

28
00:04:19,975 --> 00:04:20,975
To the valley?

29
00:04:20,975 --> 00:04:22,975
Yes, to the valley. So come on, get up.

30
00:04:24,475 --> 00:04:25,975
But pull yourself together, it's cold.

31
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:27,975
Of course, I am also the big waltz.

32
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:16,247
Hide it, you haven't seen it yet.

33
00:05:17,247 --> 00:05:19,247
Are we both going to fit in there?

34
00:05:19,247 --> 00:05:21,247
If you make yourself small.

35
00:05:22,247 --> 00:05:24,247
Apparently your man will have to put you on, so come on.

36
00:05:26,247 --> 00:05:28,247
It's nice and warm in here.

37
00:05:28,247 --> 00:05:30,247
We can go now.

38
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,247
Hold on tight, so you don't fall down.

39
00:05:32,247 --> 00:05:33,247
It's steep downhill.

40
00:05:33,247 --> 00:05:35,247
Of course, I won't fall down, don't worry.

43
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,820
Does Peter live in there?

44
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,820
Yes.

45
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,020
But it's not nice here.

46
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,020
Before it gets dark, you'll be back home, understand?

47
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,020
But you're not coming in with me?

48
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,020
No, you're invited.

49
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,020
Hmm, that's right.

50
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,020
Peter?

51
00:07:35,892 --> 00:07:37,892
are you ready, dad?

52
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:47,396
I'm from the Alps, Oei. Peter was recently with us and he invited me.

53
00:07:47,396 --> 00:07:49,396
He said they wanted that.

54
00:07:49,396 --> 00:07:50,396
Aha.

55
00:07:50,396 --> 00:07:52,396
Today I could finally come.

56
00:07:52,396 --> 00:07:56,396
So you're the little girl who wants to be a goat herder.

57
00:07:56,396 --> 00:07:59,396
I'm glad you came, you're holy.

58
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,396
Did Peter tell you about the goat herder?

59
00:08:01,396 --> 00:08:03,396
Yes, he often told me about it.

60
00:08:03,396 --> 00:08:06,396
What beautiful warm hands you have, my child.

61
00:08:06,396 --> 00:08:08,396
What is that?

62
00:08:08,396 --> 00:08:13,396
Doesn't that bother you at all?

63
00:08:13,786 --> 00:08:17,286
If you don't fix your window sill right away, he'll fall down for sure.

64
00:08:17,286 --> 00:08:19,786
He's only hanging on a single thin nail.

65
00:08:19,786 --> 00:08:21,286
I know, my child, I know.

66
00:08:21,286 --> 00:08:23,286
He's been knocking for a long time, so terrible.

67
00:08:23,286 --> 00:08:24,786
But what am I supposed to do?

68
00:08:24,786 --> 00:08:27,786
Go and nail it. That's quite easy.

69
00:08:30,786 --> 00:08:32,786
The house is already very old.

70
00:08:33,286 --> 00:08:35,786
Here he knocks and knocks on all corners.

71
00:08:40,308 --> 00:08:42,308
Maybe you can do something.

72
00:08:42,308 --> 00:08:44,308
Look at him.

73
00:08:44,308 --> 00:08:46,308
That's not possible.

74
00:08:46,308 --> 00:08:48,308
I would like to look at him.

75
00:08:48,308 --> 00:08:50,308
But I'm blind, Heidi.

76
00:08:56,308 --> 00:08:58,308
Why don't you say anything, Heidi?

77
00:08:58,308 --> 00:09:00,308
Did Peter forget to tell you

78
00:09:00,308 --> 00:09:02,308
what's going on with his grandmother?

79
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:03,495
Yes.

80
00:09:03,495 --> 00:09:07,495
I don't see anything anymore, but I hear every sound.

81
00:09:07,495 --> 00:09:10,495
At night I often lie awake and listen.

82
00:09:10,495 --> 00:09:14,495
And when the wind is howling around the hut and it's whistling everywhere,

83
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,495
then I sometimes get scared.

84
00:09:16,495 --> 00:09:18,495
But that can't stay that way.

85
00:09:18,495 --> 00:09:20,495
You have to do something about it.

86
00:09:20,495 --> 00:09:22,495
It's all bad.

87
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:25,495
You get used to it over time.

88
00:09:25,495 --> 00:09:27,495
It's all half as bad.

89
00:09:27,495 --> 00:09:29,495
Sometimes I want to be able to see.

90
00:09:29,495 --> 00:09:31,053
Then come...

91
00:09:31,265 --> 00:09:35,265
Just go outside with me. Maybe you can see there. The sun is shining there.

92
00:09:35,265 --> 00:09:39,265
No, no, Heidi. I can't see anything outside either.

93
00:09:39,265 --> 00:09:41,265
No? Oh...

94
00:09:41,265 --> 00:09:45,265
If a person is blind, Heidi, then he can't see anywhere. Not outside either.

95
00:09:45,265 --> 00:09:47,265
That's not true.

96
00:09:54,817 --> 00:10:04,817
Come with me anyway. You can't always sit here. It's really nice and warm
outside. Come on, I can show it to you. You have to come with me. You'll
definitely like it. I know it.

97
00:10:04,817 --> 00:10:11,817
For me, it's better if I stay here in the hut, Heidi. I haven't been outside for
so many years, my child.

98
00:10:11,817 --> 00:10:14,817
Then you're going out for the first time today.

99
00:10:14,817 --> 00:10:18,817
How can a nice girl like you get so angry?

100
00:10:18,817 --> 00:10:20,775
Sorry.

101
00:10:20,775 --> 00:10:25,775
Don't worry Heidi, when I was a little girl, I was always angry too.

102
00:10:25,775 --> 00:10:29,775
If I didn't like something, I always stepped on it with my feet.

103
00:10:29,775 --> 00:10:31,775
You too?

104
00:10:31,775 --> 00:10:35,775
You said that you can't see anything, but you also said that you can hear
everything.

105
00:10:35,775 --> 00:10:39,775
So why don't you come outside with me in the snow and listen to the winter?

106
00:10:39,775 --> 00:10:43,775
Why are you shaking your head back and forth? Don't you want to go outside at
all?

107
00:10:43,775 --> 00:10:46,775
What a sweet little girl you are.

108
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:53,919
I can understand my Peter very well, that he likes you so much, but it doesn't
make any sense, Heidi. Leave me alone.

109
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:59,919
You can't do adventures with an old woman like me. It's too late.

110
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:04,919
Let me sit here on my spinning wheel, Heidi. That's the best thing for me.

111
00:11:20,705 --> 00:11:22,705
Little Heidi.

112
00:11:28,481 --> 00:11:30,481
What is good, Heidi?

113
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:34,481
Nothing is good. No, I don't want to.

114
00:11:34,481 --> 00:11:37,481
Can't you really do anything to help you?

115
00:11:37,481 --> 00:11:41,481
Can't you do anything so you can see again?

116
00:11:41,481 --> 00:11:43,245
Nothing, Heidi.

117
00:11:53,409 --> 00:11:59,909
Heidi, you can't imagine how many beautiful pictures I've seen in my long life.

118
00:11:59,909 --> 00:12:04,909
And all these pictures live in me and I remember them.

119
00:12:04,909 --> 00:12:08,909
Heidi was so happy to visit Peter's hut.

120
00:12:08,909 --> 00:12:12,890
And now everything was completely different from what she had imagined.

121
00:12:16,974 --> 00:12:19,974
Sometimes it's very hard to see something.

122
00:12:23,974 --> 00:12:25,974
I've come up with something.

123
00:12:25,974 --> 00:12:29,974
When I come home tonight, I will describe everything exactly to my grandfather.

124
00:12:29,974 --> 00:12:31,974
From you and your clattering window shop.

125
00:12:31,974 --> 00:12:34,974
Then he will come down to you in the morning and repair the hut.

126
00:12:34,974 --> 00:12:36,974
If I ask him to, he will do it.

127
00:12:36,974 --> 00:12:39,974
And then you don't have to be afraid anymore when the wind blows.

128
00:12:39,974 --> 00:12:41,974
That's a very good idea.

129
00:12:41,974 --> 00:12:43,974
You are a very, very nice girl, Heidi.

130
00:12:43,974 --> 00:12:45,974
I'm glad you came.

131
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:47,162
Thank you very much.

132
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:55,310
Come in, Brigitte. We had a very surprising visit today.

133
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:03,310
That's Heidi, you know, the little one who's been living at the AlmÃ¶he since
last summer.

134
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:10,310
That's Heidi? She looks a bit like her mother.

135
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:16,310
She looked the same as a little girl. Are you doing well at the AlmÃ¶he, my
child?

136
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:17,412
Yes, I am.

137
00:13:17,412 --> 00:13:20,412
He could have seen himself again in the village.

138
00:13:20,412 --> 00:13:22,412
He wasn't here either.

139
00:13:22,412 --> 00:13:25,412
He left the little girl at the door and then he left again.

140
00:13:25,412 --> 00:13:28,412
Or did you come down all alone?

141
00:13:28,412 --> 00:13:32,412
But no, the grandfather brought me on the sled.

142
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:34,412
That's unbelievable.

143
00:13:34,412 --> 00:13:38,412
Our AlmÃ¶he was supposed to be on a sled with you?

144
00:13:38,412 --> 00:13:42,412
We were so fast that the birds were not even faster than our sled.

145
00:13:42,412 --> 00:13:44,412
Yes?

146
00:13:45,332 --> 00:13:50,332
I don't believe that. The child has to go crazy. The moose and your sled, that
doesn't fit.

147
00:13:50,332 --> 00:13:54,332
I know the old grasshopper. He can't even say hello anymore for years.

148
00:13:54,332 --> 00:14:00,332
The grandfather is not a grasshopper! And if he doesn't say hello to someone,
then he has a reason for it!

149
00:14:00,332 --> 00:14:06,332
He must have changed. Peter told me recently that he would be like an exchange
student, not to be recognized again.

150
00:14:06,332 --> 00:14:08,332
An exchange student?

151
00:14:08,332 --> 00:14:12,332
Peter said your grandfather would be very nice to you. He would like to have
you.

152
00:14:12,332 --> 00:14:14,308
Yes, he did.

153
00:14:14,308 --> 00:14:18,308
So, if that's true, then the world will turn around in a different way.

154
00:14:18,308 --> 00:14:20,308
I only believe it when I've seen it.

155
00:14:20,308 --> 00:14:22,308
Believe it.

156
00:14:22,308 --> 00:14:28,308
Why don't you tell us about what's going on up there?

157
00:14:28,308 --> 00:14:32,308
We'd like to know how you're doing and what you're doing.

158
00:14:32,308 --> 00:14:34,308
I don't know where to start.

159
00:14:34,308 --> 00:14:38,100
Just tell us everything that comes to your mind.

160
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:43,600
Well, I always get up really early in the morning and then I eat a huge mountain
of food for breakfast.

161
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:04,025
It's just wonderful that I can be with my grandfather.

162
00:15:04,025 --> 00:15:07,025
I'm happy for you that you like it.

163
00:15:07,025 --> 00:15:09,025
It's impossible to invent everything.

164
00:15:09,025 --> 00:15:11,025
There has to be something real about it.

165
00:15:11,025 --> 00:15:12,025
Strange.

166
00:15:12,025 --> 00:15:14,025
She doesn't believe it.

167
00:15:14,025 --> 00:15:18,025
Do you believe me at least or can't you imagine it?

168
00:15:18,025 --> 00:15:19,025
Hello!

169
00:15:19,025 --> 00:15:20,025
Peter!

170
00:15:21,025 --> 00:15:22,025
Yes, tell me.

171
00:15:22,025 --> 00:15:24,025
Where are you staying so long?

172
00:15:24,025 --> 00:15:26,025
In the stupid school, of course. Where else?

173
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,717
How was your day at school today, Peter?

174
00:15:29,717 --> 00:15:31,217
Is there anything to tell us?

175
00:15:31,217 --> 00:15:32,517
Were you there today?

176
00:15:32,517 --> 00:15:33,717
Yes, twice.

177
00:15:33,717 --> 00:15:36,717
Did your answers to the questions you were asked

178
00:15:36,717 --> 00:15:38,217
turn out to be the same as always,

179
00:15:38,217 --> 00:15:41,717
or did you expect something different today?

180
00:15:41,717 --> 00:15:43,217
At least half of it.

181
00:15:44,717 --> 00:15:46,217
I knew something.

182
00:15:46,217 --> 00:15:48,217
Yes, yes, I understand.

183
00:15:48,717 --> 00:15:51,717
You didn't expect what you knew

184
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:53,717
from the teacher.

185
00:15:54,225 --> 00:15:59,525
And of course you can't do anything about it that the teacher is so stupid and
doesn't know what you know.

186
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:03,325
Maybe he really can't do anything about it. Why are you so angry with him?

187
00:16:03,325 --> 00:16:08,825
Oh, I'm just disappointed. Peter will soon be 12 years old and he still can't
read.

188
00:16:08,825 --> 00:16:12,325
Brigitte, please give me the book.

189
00:16:12,325 --> 00:16:17,425
It's a beautiful book. It's full of stories and poems.

190
00:16:17,425 --> 00:16:22,825
And I finally want Peter to learn to read, to read it to me.

191
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:26,881
Unfortunately, I can no longer read by myself.

192
00:16:27,881 --> 00:16:31,881
It's very difficult. Be careful that you don't drop it, Heidi.

193
00:16:31,881 --> 00:16:36,881
It's my only book. I won't get another one.

194
00:16:37,881 --> 00:16:41,881
Peter, you read it to me one year ago for the last time.

195
00:16:41,881 --> 00:16:44,881
Try again. Maybe it's better now.

196
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:48,881
It's not better. It's even worse.

197
00:16:48,881 --> 00:16:50,881
Then don't.

198
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:13,099
Soon the sun will set. Don't you have to get up slowly?

199
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:18,099
Yes, it's actually getting a little dark outside. I didn't even notice how late
it was.

200
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:21,099
Yes, the time has also passed quickly.

201
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:26,099
I would be very happy, my child, if you would come to visit me again soon.

202
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:30,099
Then come when I'm free from school. If you tell me when that is.

203
00:17:30,099 --> 00:17:34,099
Thank you very much for letting me come today. I liked it very, very much here.

204
00:17:34,099 --> 00:17:37,099
I'm looking forward to it, too, my child. Goodbye.

205
00:17:38,523 --> 00:17:41,523
- Heidi? - Yes? Did I forget something?

206
00:17:41,523 --> 00:17:45,523
- Didn't you bring a warm scarf? - No, I didn't have one with me.

207
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:48,523
You can't go without a scarf. It's too cold outside.

208
00:17:48,523 --> 00:17:51,523
- Peter, tie mine to the child. - Thank you.

209
00:17:51,523 --> 00:17:54,523
When I come to visit next time, I'll bring him back.

210
00:17:54,523 --> 00:17:57,523
- Not so fast! - Come on, I can do it again.

211
00:17:57,523 --> 00:18:00,523
Peter, take Heidi home and make sure nothing happens to her.

212
00:18:00,523 --> 00:18:03,523
- It's always very smooth in the evening. - I will.

213
00:18:03,523 --> 00:18:05,523
We're already careful.

214
00:18:06,824 --> 00:18:10,824
Goodbye. See you soon. - Goodbye, Heidi.

215
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:14,824
Goodbye, Brigitte. - The old one.

216
00:18:14,824 --> 00:18:16,824
Grandfather!

217
00:18:18,824 --> 00:18:22,824
You look happy. It seems to have been fun. - Yes, it has.

218
00:18:22,824 --> 00:18:26,824
Peter, you can take the scarf back with you. - Thank you.

219
00:18:26,824 --> 00:18:28,824
Live well, Peter.

220
00:18:28,824 --> 00:18:32,824
Oh, ruck! Tell your grandmother a nice greeting.

221
00:18:32,824 --> 00:18:35,824
Yes, I will. - Live well!

222
00:18:43,432 --> 00:18:45,432
You don't think that's possible.

223
00:18:47,432 --> 00:18:51,432
I think I'm dreaming. What I saw out there can't be true.

224
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:55,432
Why are you so upset? - He picked her up.

225
00:18:56,432 --> 00:18:58,432
That's good. So it's true.

226
00:18:59,432 --> 00:19:02,432
Peter was right. He really likes the girl.

227
00:19:03,432 --> 00:19:05,432
The almsman said I should say hello.

228
00:19:06,432 --> 00:19:09,432
You should say hello to him? The child has changed him.

229
00:19:09,432 --> 00:19:13,432
Yes, the little one knows how to deal with people.

230
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:17,886
You just have to like her, hopefully she'll come back soon.

231
00:19:24,136 --> 00:19:31,136
Tomorrow morning we have to go down to the grandmother again and then we have to
take a hammer with us and a lot of nails.

232
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:36,136
You have to repair her window shops, you can do that.

233
00:19:36,136 --> 00:19:42,136
I can and will not forbid you to visit these people, Heidi. But I don't want to
have anything to do with them.

234
00:19:42,136 --> 00:19:45,136
Why? I don't believe that.

235
00:19:45,136 --> 00:19:47,136
What has she done to you?

236
00:19:47,136 --> 00:19:48,136
Who?

237
00:19:48,136 --> 00:19:51,136
She can't even go to the house.

238
00:19:51,136 --> 00:19:53,136
Grandfather, what do you have?

239
00:19:53,136 --> 00:19:54,228
I don't know.

240
00:20:18,728 --> 00:20:22,728
I've been wondering all this time, now it's time to wake up.

241
00:20:22,728 --> 00:20:24,728
-Greetings, grandmother! -Heidi.

242
00:20:24,728 --> 00:20:27,728
Why are you holding your head? Does it hurt?

243
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:30,728
Oh, come on, Heidi, get me into safety.

244
00:20:30,728 --> 00:20:34,728
The hut is about to collapse. Oh dear, oh dear, that I have to experience that.

245
00:20:34,728 --> 00:20:37,728
Oh, what? Have you already forgotten, grandmother?

246
00:20:37,728 --> 00:20:41,728
I promised you yesterday that I would come down with my grandfather again.

247
00:20:41,728 --> 00:20:45,728
My God, where are we going when the hut collapses?

248
00:20:45,728 --> 00:20:45,966
-Greetings, grandmother! -Greetings, grandmother!

249
00:20:45,966 --> 00:20:49,966
I can't hear anything. The noise is coming from the grandfather in my window
shop.

250
00:20:49,966 --> 00:20:52,966
The AlmÃ¶. Brigitte, did you hear what the child said?

251
00:20:52,966 --> 00:20:56,966
The AlmÃ¶ came down there to repair my window shop.

252
00:20:56,966 --> 00:20:58,966
I heard that.

253
00:20:59,966 --> 00:21:03,966
Yes, that's what it sounds like when someone hits wood with a hammer.

254
00:21:03,966 --> 00:21:05,966
Now everything will be fine again.

255
00:21:05,966 --> 00:21:10,966
Now I finally don't have to hear this terrible squeaking all day and all night.

256
00:21:10,966 --> 00:21:12,966
Do you hear the knocking, Brigitte?

257
00:21:12,966 --> 00:21:14,966
Yes, of course I hear it.

258
00:21:19,509 --> 00:21:23,509
Good morning, Almehuy. We are very grateful to you for this.

259
00:21:25,509 --> 00:21:30,509
We would be very happy if you came in for a cup of milk to warm you up, Almehuy.

260
00:21:32,509 --> 00:21:37,509
It is very kind of you to have come to help us, Almehuy. Thank you very much.

261
00:21:37,509 --> 00:21:39,509
You've talked enough. Go back in.

262
00:21:39,509 --> 00:21:44,509
I'm repairing the hut because the child asked me to, and for no other reason.

263
00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:48,509
What are you still standing around for?

264
00:21:49,621 --> 00:21:51,621
I understand.

265
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:21,059
He didn't want to talk to anyone.

266
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:49,069
Peter's grandmother was as happy and satisfied this evening as she has been for
many, many years.

267
00:22:52,069 --> 00:23:01,069
The next day it snowed again and neither Heidi could go down into the valley to
visit Peter, nor could Peter climb up to meet Heidi.

268
00:23:01,069 --> 00:23:09,069
Only when the weather got better, the two saw each other again and they had an
experience that Heidi could not forget so quickly.

269
00:23:09,355 --> 00:23:20,355
Many days she thought of nothing else but her animals, which she thought were in
danger and finally she managed to convince the alp Oehi to go out into the
snowstorm to help.

270
00:23:20,355 --> 00:23:26,355
But we want to tell you about this and the new adventures that Heidi experienced
in our next story.
