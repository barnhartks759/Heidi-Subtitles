00:00:20,206 --> 00:00:24,206
Heidi, Heidi

4
00:00:24,206 --> 00:00:28,206
Your world are the mountains

5
00:00:28,206 --> 00:00:32,206
Heidi, Heidi

6
00:00:32,206 --> 00:00:36,206
Because up here you are at home

7
00:00:36,206 --> 00:00:40,206
Dark fir trees

8
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:44,206
Green meadows in the sunshine

9
00:00:44,206 --> 00:00:48,206
Heidi, Heidi

10
00:00:48,206 --> 00:00:52,206
You need to be happy

11
00:00:52,206 --> 00:01:01,206
Holadio

Heidi, Heidi

15
00:01:10,206 --> 00:01:12,206
Come home

16
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:14,206
Find your happiness

17
00:01:14,206 --> 00:01:19,206
Come back home

18
00:01:32,206 --> 00:01:34,206
Holadio

19
00:01:34,206 --> 00:01:37,206
Peter, wake up!

20
00:01:40,206 --> 00:01:42,206
Hurry up!

21
00:01:42,206 --> 00:01:44,206
Yes, I'm coming!

22
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:47,206
Tomorrow!

23
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:50,482
Is it true that you got a few more goats this year?

24
00:01:50,482 --> 00:01:51,482
Yes!

25
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:54,166
There I am again!

26
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:36,986
Hello Peter!

27
00:02:36,986 --> 00:02:39,986
Peter, so you're leaving this year as well?

28
00:02:39,986 --> 00:02:42,986
-Morning, Peter! -Good morning!

29
00:02:42,986 --> 00:02:45,986
-This time I'm taking the white one with me. -Yes, that's good.

30
00:02:45,986 --> 00:02:48,986
Hello, Schnucki, you haven't grown up yet.

31
00:03:06,741 --> 00:03:09,741
Finally, I don't have to go to school.

32
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,273
I don't have to go to school.

33
00:03:40,273 --> 00:03:42,273
Good morning!

34
00:03:50,273 --> 00:03:52,273
Good morning!

35
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,205
Since when have you been...

36
00:03:53,205 --> 00:03:57,205
Slowly it will be time for you to get up, you sleeping hat.

37
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:59,537
Here comes Peter with the goat herd.

38
00:04:01,537 --> 00:04:03,537
Good morning, Joseph, get up!

39
00:04:13,537 --> 00:04:15,537
Good morning, Svenli, good morning, Berli.

40
00:04:15,537 --> 00:04:17,537
No, not again, no!

41
00:04:19,537 --> 00:04:21,537
Why do you have to be so wild?

42
00:04:21,537 --> 00:04:23,537
Let it be!

43
00:04:23,537 --> 00:04:25,537
You also know that it goes back to the pasture.

44
00:04:27,537 --> 00:04:29,537
Berli, Berli!

45
00:04:37,537 --> 00:04:38,069
Fuck!

46
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,069
You can jump better than me!

47
00:04:41,577 --> 00:04:42,577
The bells!

48
00:04:44,577 --> 00:04:47,577
Down there Peter and his herd are coming up the slope!

49
00:04:48,577 --> 00:04:50,577
Peter!

50
00:04:51,577 --> 00:04:52,577
Heidi!

51
00:04:56,577 --> 00:04:58,577
Faster than running!

52
00:05:00,577 --> 00:05:01,577
Oh yes!

53
00:05:06,577 --> 00:05:09,577
I roll and roll and roll and roll and roll!

54
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:10,613
I roll and roll and roll!

55
00:05:10,613 --> 00:05:12,613
Heidi, stop it now!

56
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:16,013
Don't be so over-tired, Heidi!

57
00:05:16,013 --> 00:05:17,077
If you hit your head...

58
00:05:17,077 --> 00:05:19,077
Now you can't go to the meadow with me!

59
00:05:19,077 --> 00:05:20,077
Mhm.

60
00:05:24,077 --> 00:05:27,077
Peter! Heidi!

61
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:29,077
Finally! The goat herd!

62
00:05:33,077 --> 00:05:36,077
There's my Schnucki again!

63
00:05:36,077 --> 00:05:38,077
Schnuckilein!

64
00:05:38,485 --> 00:05:42,485
Dear Snooki, I wanted to come visit you in the winter, but unfortunately it
didn't work out.

65
00:05:42,485 --> 00:05:43,485
Good day!

66
00:05:43,485 --> 00:05:45,485
Well, how are you?

67
00:05:45,485 --> 00:05:47,485
And you're back again!

68
00:05:47,485 --> 00:05:49,485
No! Leave that alone!

69
00:05:49,485 --> 00:05:51,485
Now we're all together again!

70
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:54,485
All summer long! I'm so happy!

71
00:05:55,485 --> 00:05:57,485
Are you also looking forward to our meadows, Peter?

72
00:05:57,485 --> 00:05:58,485
I can't even...

73
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,670
We have to wait until we finally go up.

74
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:01,670
Of course, and how?

75
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,670
Then let's all listen to each other well!

76
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,670
Come on!

77
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,670
Don't run so fast!

78
00:06:12,912 --> 00:06:14,912
Stop! Wait!

79
00:06:17,712 --> 00:06:18,712
Peter!

80
00:06:20,212 --> 00:06:21,712
Good day, Mr. Oey!

81
00:06:21,712 --> 00:06:24,212
So it's starting again now, General Ziegen?

82
00:06:24,212 --> 00:06:25,212
Uh-huh.

83
00:06:25,412 --> 00:06:27,312
Will you take that with you, Peter?

84
00:06:27,312 --> 00:06:29,912
The saint has forgotten it. You know what.

85
00:06:29,912 --> 00:06:31,912
Where are you staying?

86
00:06:32,712 --> 00:06:35,312
Go on, Peter, and take good care of her.

87
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,712
In the meantime, I'm going down into the village to buy in.

88
00:06:37,712 --> 00:06:40,312
Tell him that, please. I'll be back on time.

89
00:06:40,312 --> 00:06:41,512
Yes, that's fine.

90
00:06:42,912 --> 00:06:44,912
Thank you, Mr. Oey.

91
00:06:54,384 --> 00:07:00,384
Like last summer, Heidi went up to the meadow with Peter and the herd of goats.

92
00:07:00,384 --> 00:07:05,384
Heidi loved this ascent. She had been waiting for it for so long.

93
00:07:07,384 --> 00:07:11,384
There, Peter, look! There are two squirrels up there!

94
00:07:16,384 --> 00:07:18,384
A bird swarm!

95
00:07:18,384 --> 00:07:21,384
The first birds are coming!

96
00:07:25,616 --> 00:07:28,616
I don't know if Piep is here.

97
00:07:33,616 --> 00:07:34,608
Hello Piepmatz!

98
00:07:34,608 --> 00:07:37,608
Oh, what? Why is he supposed to be there?

99
00:07:38,268 --> 00:07:42,268
Peep, do you not know me anymore? It's me, Heidi!

100
00:07:44,268 --> 00:07:48,268
Tell me, is there a bird among you called Peep and sometimes Peepmatz?

101
00:07:55,268 --> 00:07:59,268
He must be there. He looks exactly like you.

102
00:08:04,268 --> 00:08:06,268
I'm Heidi.

103
00:08:08,268 --> 00:08:11,268
Do you know him?

104
00:08:11,504 --> 00:08:16,504
Tell him that I haven't forgotten him and that I'm waiting for him.

105
00:08:19,504 --> 00:08:22,504
Search for him for me! Fly away!

106
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:25,504
Ask everywhere, please!

107
00:08:27,056 --> 00:08:34,056
Heidi firmly believed that she would see the little bird she had raised last
summer again one day.

108
00:08:41,232 --> 00:08:45,232
Exactly! You'll find him for sure! You have to find him!

109
00:08:58,731 --> 00:09:02,731
They will find him and they will tell him about me and then he will come back.

110
00:09:04,731 --> 00:09:07,731
Just like I said, he came back.

111
00:09:07,731 --> 00:09:11,731
If he came back, he should be here somewhere. I don't see him.

112
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:14,731
Of course the others have to inform him first.

113
00:09:14,731 --> 00:09:15,731
Inform him?

114
00:09:15,731 --> 00:09:18,731
Of course, how should he know?

115
00:09:18,731 --> 00:09:20,731
Of course, how should he know?

116
00:09:22,731 --> 00:09:24,343
You know what? You're just right!

117
00:09:24,343 --> 00:09:26,343
You're just right!

118
00:09:26,343 --> 00:09:28,343
Hahaha!

119
00:09:28,343 --> 00:09:30,343
Hahaha!

120
00:09:30,343 --> 00:09:32,343
Juhu!

121
00:09:38,343 --> 00:09:40,343
Yes!

122
00:09:40,343 --> 00:09:42,343
Hahaha!

123
00:09:46,343 --> 00:09:48,343
Hahaha!

124
00:09:48,343 --> 00:09:50,343
Hahaha!

125
00:09:50,343 --> 00:09:52,343
Hahaha!

126
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:54,343
Juhu!

127
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,343
Hahaha!

128
00:09:56,343 --> 00:09:58,343
Hahaha!

129
00:10:02,343 --> 00:10:04,343
I won!

130
00:10:04,343 --> 00:10:06,343
Hahaha!

131
00:10:06,343 --> 00:10:08,343
Hahaha!

132
00:10:08,343 --> 00:10:10,343
Hahaha!

133
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,343
Hahaha!

134
00:10:12,343 --> 00:10:14,343
Hahaha!

135
00:10:14,343 --> 00:10:16,343
Hahaha!

136
00:10:16,343 --> 00:10:18,343
Even the little flag is there,

137
00:10:18,343 --> 00:10:19,787
where it always stood.

138
00:10:19,787 --> 00:10:21,787
Are you sick or why are you lying on the floor?

139
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:22,787
As healthy as today!

140
00:10:22,935 --> 00:10:24,935
I haven't seen you for a long time!

141
00:10:52,935 --> 00:10:57,935
Peter, wake up! There's an eagle flying up there!

142
00:10:59,935 --> 00:11:01,935
It's big!

143
00:11:03,935 --> 00:11:06,935
Wake up! When can you see an eagle?

144
00:11:16,935 --> 00:11:19,935
Fly around here until Peter wakes up!

145
00:11:20,935 --> 00:11:23,935
Oh, there's still snow here!

146
00:11:30,935 --> 00:11:33,935
But that's cold! Ice cold!

147
00:11:37,935 --> 00:11:40,935
There are two standing back there and they're paying attention!

148
00:11:43,935 --> 00:11:46,935
But they're not just two!

149
00:11:49,935 --> 00:11:51,935
Oh, they're morphing animals!

150
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,867
And I've already wondered what they were!

151
00:11:53,867 --> 00:11:56,867
They were just as afraid of me as I was of them.

152
00:11:56,867 --> 00:11:58,867
But there's still a lot of snow here.

153
00:11:58,867 --> 00:12:00,867
The spring must have forgotten that.

154
00:12:03,867 --> 00:12:05,867
What's going on down there?

155
00:12:10,598 --> 00:12:14,598
That would be steep if I fell down there. A stonebuck!

156
00:12:29,574 --> 00:12:32,574
That was wonderful! You can climb!

157
00:12:35,574 --> 00:12:38,574
What a beautiful animal!

158
00:12:39,986 --> 00:12:41,986
* Music *

159
00:13:09,986 --> 00:13:11,986
*Sigh*

160
00:13:11,986 --> 00:13:13,986
*Sigh*

161
00:13:13,986 --> 00:13:15,986
*Sigh*

162
00:13:15,986 --> 00:13:17,986
Heidi?

163
00:13:17,986 --> 00:13:19,718
Just...

164
00:13:19,718 --> 00:13:21,718
She was still here.

165
00:13:27,318 --> 00:13:28,718
Heidi!

166
00:13:30,318 --> 00:13:32,718
Heidi, where are you?

167
00:13:34,518 --> 00:13:35,918
Where have you been?

168
00:13:37,638 --> 00:13:39,638
Just tear it out.

169
00:13:39,638 --> 00:13:40,638
Hurry up!

170
00:13:40,638 --> 00:13:41,638
Tag!

171
00:13:41,638 --> 00:13:43,638
You shouldn't run away. What if you crash?

172
00:13:43,638 --> 00:13:45,638
Guess what I've got. A flower wreath.

173
00:13:45,638 --> 00:13:47,638
I've got one for you too.

174
00:13:47,638 --> 00:13:51,638
For me? Hmm. Nice.

175
00:13:51,638 --> 00:13:53,638
Here, you can hang it around your neck.

176
00:13:53,638 --> 00:13:55,638
No, no, thank you.

177
00:13:55,638 --> 00:13:57,638
Why not? They've become beautiful.

178
00:13:57,638 --> 00:13:59,638
I've wove them evenly.

179
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:01,638
No, that's not it.

180
00:14:01,638 --> 00:14:03,638
Well.

181
00:14:03,638 --> 00:14:05,638
There. The wreath fits you well.

182
00:14:05,638 --> 00:14:07,638
The wreath, really. It fits you.

183
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,540
- Now I look like a phoenix. - Oh, really?

184
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,940
- Yes. - You look very good in it.

185
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,540
- Much better than before. - Maybe.

186
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,740
I like it quite a lot.

187
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,340
I still hope no one sees me in it.

188
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,340
What is she doing?

189
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,940
Here, Schnucki.

190
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,940
There, Perli. There's something for you.

191
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:34,740
- Tell me, what are you doing? - You can see it.

192
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,940
I hope you like it.

193
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,110
I hope you like it.

194
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,110
Take a look at this one!

195
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,262
You have to keep it!

196
00:14:50,262 --> 00:14:52,262
But please don't eat it!

197
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:59,262
This is the most beautiful goat herd in the whole world!

198
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:06,633
Heidi was as overbearing as ever. She would have loved to have embraced the
whole world.

199
00:15:06,633 --> 00:15:09,633
She jumped and sang and danced and wanted to jump higher than the goats.

200
00:15:09,633 --> 00:15:14,633
The snow had not yet melted everywhere, but the summer had begun for her.

201
00:15:14,633 --> 00:15:16,633
You might look stupid.

202
00:15:25,345 --> 00:15:27,345
The weather is changing!

203
00:15:28,365 --> 00:15:31,365
- Why is it so dark all of a sudden? - A thunderstorm!

204
00:15:58,365 --> 00:16:00,365
- Why is it so dark all of a sudden? - A thunderstorm!

205
00:16:28,365 --> 00:16:30,365
- Why is it so dark all of a sudden? - A thunderstorm!

206
00:16:58,365 --> 00:17:00,365
Why is it so dark all of a sudden?

207
00:17:02,365 --> 00:17:03,365
It stopped again!

208
00:17:04,365 --> 00:17:05,365
Yeah, I saw it!

209
00:17:12,193 --> 00:17:14,193
Peter, we suddenly have a little sheep.

210
00:17:16,693 --> 00:17:18,693
It's very nice, but it doesn't belong to us.

211
00:17:18,693 --> 00:17:21,693
It will have run away during the thunderstorm, that's all.

212
00:17:22,193 --> 00:17:24,693
Who do you belong to, little sheep? Tell me!

213
00:17:26,193 --> 00:17:27,193
Alma!

214
00:17:28,193 --> 00:17:29,193
Alma!

215
00:17:30,693 --> 00:17:31,297
Alma!

216
00:17:31,297 --> 00:17:38,297
It must belong to another herd, and if there is a herd here, then there is also
a herd, and he will look for it.

217
00:17:38,297 --> 00:17:44,297
He comes here, finds the sheep with us, and thinks, of course, we stole it from
him.

218
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:46,297
But we didn't steal it!

219
00:17:46,297 --> 00:17:51,297
Alma! Give the sheep back to you!

220
00:17:51,297 --> 00:17:53,297
It ran away in the rain.

221
00:17:53,297 --> 00:17:54,945
What is it?

222
00:17:54,945 --> 00:17:57,945
Come here, I'll show you how to run away!

223
00:17:57,945 --> 00:17:59,945
It didn't do anything!

224
00:18:00,945 --> 00:18:01,945
Stop it!

225
00:18:01,945 --> 00:18:04,945
Don't interfere, it doesn't concern you at all!

226
00:18:04,945 --> 00:18:05,945
It does concern me.

227
00:18:05,945 --> 00:18:10,945
I'll show you the only thing you can put your nose into, you shameless beast
thief!

228
00:18:10,945 --> 00:18:13,945
Or do you want to tell me you didn't steal it?

229
00:18:13,945 --> 00:18:15,945
Of course I didn't steal it!

230
00:18:15,945 --> 00:18:19,945
We can't do anything about it, it got lost in the thunderstorm, it came all by
itself!

231
00:18:19,945 --> 00:18:21,945
I know what I see, and that's enough for me!

232
00:18:21,945 --> 00:18:24,945
That's not enough at all, because it's just not true!

233
00:18:26,012 --> 00:18:28,012
Does anyone have any more words?

234
00:18:28,012 --> 00:18:30,012
Is the little one really messing with me?

235
00:18:30,012 --> 00:18:34,012
Tell me, are you sure that you're not sick in the head?

236
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:36,012
Are you sure of yourself?

237
00:18:37,012 --> 00:18:40,012
Stealing animals from other people and then being cheeky,

238
00:18:40,012 --> 00:18:42,012
that fits both well together.

239
00:18:42,012 --> 00:18:44,012
We didn't steal at all!

240
00:18:44,012 --> 00:18:47,012
You're probably just as crazy as your grandfather.

241
00:18:48,012 --> 00:18:50,012
If anyone here is crazy, then you see!

242
00:18:50,012 --> 00:18:51,012
What?

243
00:18:51,012 --> 00:18:54,012
Someone who hits a helpless animal with such a big nipple,

244
00:18:54,012 --> 00:18:56,012
must be crazy!

245
00:18:56,012 --> 00:18:57,012
That's not normal!

246
00:18:57,052 --> 00:19:00,052
Say that again, huh?

247
00:19:01,052 --> 00:19:04,052
What do you understand about goats and herds?

248
00:19:04,052 --> 00:19:06,052
You can see right away that you belong to the circus!

249
00:19:06,052 --> 00:19:08,052
Take your fingers away!

250
00:19:08,052 --> 00:19:10,052
Let it go, it belongs to Peter!

251
00:19:10,052 --> 00:19:12,052
Let's see!

252
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:16,052
You mean, old, disgusting man!

253
00:19:16,732 --> 00:19:19,732
Don't be shy, or I'll forget about you!

254
00:19:21,732 --> 00:19:23,732
Come here, you little brat!

255
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:27,732
I'll pay for that!

256
00:19:28,732 --> 00:19:29,732
I'll catch you!

257
00:19:29,732 --> 00:19:32,732
And now watch how you get out of here, you little brat!

258
00:19:37,732 --> 00:19:40,732
I'll beat you so hard you'll never play again!

259
00:19:43,732 --> 00:19:44,476
Are you crazy?

260
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:47,476
Let go of my arm, you little turtle!

261
00:19:47,476 --> 00:19:48,476
Let go!

262
00:19:49,476 --> 00:19:50,476
Stop it!

263
00:19:50,476 --> 00:19:52,476
I'll show you, my son!

264
00:19:52,476 --> 00:19:53,476
Ouch!

265
00:19:53,476 --> 00:19:55,476
Let go of him!

266
00:19:55,476 --> 00:19:56,476
Don't touch me!

267
00:19:56,476 --> 00:19:58,476
He's supposed to bite you!

268
00:19:59,196 --> 00:20:01,196
What? Who's that, Joseph?

269
00:20:02,196 --> 00:20:05,196
It's a giant dog! It's at least three times as big as you!

270
00:20:05,196 --> 00:20:06,196
With such a mouth!

271
00:20:06,196 --> 00:20:08,196
It's standing back there!

272
00:20:08,196 --> 00:20:10,196
Where? Where is your dog?

273
00:20:10,196 --> 00:20:11,708
I don't see any.

274
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:14,708
There is no dog here!

275
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,352
You have lied!

276
00:20:17,352 --> 00:20:19,352
Joseph, you heard me cry! I was here!

277
00:20:24,352 --> 00:20:26,352
Help! Help! Help!

278
00:20:37,352 --> 00:20:39,352
Joseph! My dear Joseph!

279
00:20:43,352 --> 00:20:44,352
Alma!

280
00:20:44,352 --> 00:20:49,352
Alma, get in motion and come at last!

281
00:20:49,352 --> 00:20:51,352
Alma, go!

282
00:20:51,352 --> 00:20:52,860
Go!

283
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:56,860
Now go to him. He won't dare to beat you anymore.

284
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,860
But the dog there, it should stay there!

285
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:07,860
But Joseph can't do anything to your dog. It looks like that.

286
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,860
The End

287
00:21:26,231 --> 00:21:29,231
It's all right. Why are you so upset?

288
00:21:29,731 --> 00:21:33,731
Grandfather! I'm so happy to be back home!

289
00:21:34,071 --> 00:21:38,071
You're back again? Weren't you in the village?

290
00:21:38,071 --> 00:21:41,071
You don't believe how Joseph helped me.

291
00:21:41,071 --> 00:21:42,071
Was it dangerous?

292
00:21:42,071 --> 00:21:43,071
Yes.

293
00:21:43,071 --> 00:21:45,071
Then tell me, I'm curious.

294
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:49,071
Peter had an incredible fight earlier.

295
00:21:49,071 --> 00:21:52,071
Yes, but what are you hiding there?

296
00:21:52,071 --> 00:21:54,071
Guess.

297
00:21:54,071 --> 00:21:57,071
That could be a hat.

298
00:21:57,101 --> 00:21:59,101
I brought it for you.

299
00:21:59,101 --> 00:22:01,101
My own hat.

300
00:22:01,101 --> 00:22:03,101
I have a hat for myself.

301
00:22:03,101 --> 00:22:05,101
I have to show it to Peter right away.

302
00:22:05,101 --> 00:22:06,101
Where is it?

303
00:22:06,101 --> 00:22:09,101
You haven't told me the story to the end yet.

304
00:22:10,101 --> 00:22:12,101
How do you like my new hat?

305
00:22:12,101 --> 00:22:14,101
Don't I look like a lady?

306
00:22:14,101 --> 00:22:16,101
No, still like Heidi.

307
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:18,101
I don't care if you like it.

308
00:22:18,101 --> 00:22:20,101
I like my hat and that's the main thing.

309
00:22:20,101 --> 00:22:23,101
I like it, I like it, I like it.

310
00:22:23,191 --> 00:22:29,191
Heidi had once again found a reason to jump around and show everyone how happy
she was

311
00:22:29,191 --> 00:22:32,191
Of course she was incredibly proud of her hat

312
00:22:32,191 --> 00:22:37,191
She walked around with it all evening and decided never to take it off again

313
00:22:48,183 --> 00:22:55,183
Already the next morning Heidi stowed her hat carefully in the closet, to raise
it for special occasions.

314
00:22:55,183 --> 00:23:03,183
She wanted to walk over the meadow with her goats undisturbed and not be
distracted by a hat in the many adventures she experienced with Peter.

315
00:23:04,183 --> 00:23:09,183
Heidi began long conversations with her tree and sometimes she dreamed badly at
night.

316
00:23:09,183 --> 00:23:15,183
She often had the feeling that something would happen in the near future that
she could not be happy about.

317
00:23:15,245 --> 00:23:23,845
Everything was still as usual. She climbed around the mountains with Peter and
was sometimes a little naive, but still, something bothered her.

318
00:23:23,845 --> 00:23:26,845
But we want to tell you about that in the next story.

319
00:23:26,845 --> 00:23:34,845
Heidi, Heidi, your world are the mountains.

320
00:23:34,845 --> 00:23:42,845
Heidi, Heidi, because up here you are at home.

321
00:23:42,845 --> 00:23:48,845
Heidi, Heidi, come home.

322
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:55,845
Find your happiness, come back home.
