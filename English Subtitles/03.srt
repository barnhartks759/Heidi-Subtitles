What kind of strange room is this?

1
00:01:56,506 --> 00:01:58,506
Where am I?

2
00:01:58,506 --> 00:02:02,506
Yes, of course, I'm on the Alm, at my grandfather's.

Good Morning! Good Morning!

You can see all the way into the valley!

Peter!

Grandfather, good morning! 

I'm already awake and dressed.

Did you sleep well, Grandfather?

You get up early, that's good.

I wake up early.

You're also here early with your goat herd, Peter.

3
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,090
- Are you always this early? 
- If I don't oversleep.

4
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,090
- Do you oversleep often? 
- Oh, there's something pulling on me.

5
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:38,090
Oh, that's just the little goat. You probably want to say good morning to me.

6
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,090
But that's nice of you.

7
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,090
You seem to like the goats. Why don't you go with Peter?

8
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,090
May I? You have nothing against it?

9
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,090
Why should I have anything against it?

10
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:51,090
Of course, you have to wash your face first.

11
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,090
- Will you wait? 
- But yes.

12
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,090
- Thank you. 
- Don't stand around like that. Come with me.

13
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,090
- Yes. - What is it? Come on.

14
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:58,438
- What is it? - What is it?

15
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:08,541
This is for you, so that you don't starve on the road, and make sure you give
some to Heidi.

16
00:03:14,133 --> 00:03:19,133
- Can I go now? Is my face clean enough, grandfather? 
- Yes, that's how I like your face.

17
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:29,133
- Do you think so? Is Joseph coming with us? 
- I doubt that. Joseph, are you going with?

18
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:34,133
- Open your eyes. 
- Then go now, you two. But be careful.

19
00:03:34,133 --> 00:03:37,133
- Yes, we definitely will be.

20
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:50,629
On this day, Heidi climbed up to the meadow for the first time with Peter and
the herd of goats.

21
00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:55,629
She had left her shoes at home. She wanted to be as free and carefree as the
goats.

22
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:05,629
They went through deep gorges, climbed up hill and then a bit back down.

23
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:10,629
And Heidi became, to Peter's great amazement, not tired for a moment.

24
00:04:11,995 --> 00:04:16,875
She asked and blabbered, her mouth just didn't want to stand still.

25
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:20,495
She wanted to know about the clouds and hear the names of the mountains and

26
00:04:20,495 --> 00:04:25,505
Heidi had to stop at every new flower to admire them.

Let's walk here. How beautiful.

Wait. Stay here. Stand still. Come here!

What's with all this silly jumping all of a sudden.

11. 18. 22. 105. 117. 5.

2. Very many.

1, 2, 3.. And where is Heidi?

Heidi! Where are you?

Heidi! Heidi!

Lost. Gone.

Disappeared.

Answer me.

Say something.

Why are you yelling?

Thank god. Just because. No reason. I'm just yelling because it's fun.

29
00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:45,669
I thought you were calling for me.

30
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:48,669
Why didn't you answer if you heard me calling?

31
00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:52,669
If something happens to you, the Almohi will shout at me until my ears burst.

32
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:56,669
Nothing will happen. 
- You never know. What are you doing?

33
00:05:56,669 --> 00:05:58,669
We have to go on.

34
00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:02,669
Can you explain to me why you are tearing off the flowers?

35
00:06:02,934 --> 00:06:05,934
I'm not tearing the flowers, I'm picking them.

36
00:06:05,934 --> 00:06:08,934
And if you don't know why you do that, I'm very, very sorry for you.

37
00:06:08,934 --> 00:06:12,934
If you were a goat, I'd say you'd eat them. But you're not one.

38
00:06:12,934 --> 00:06:13,934
Goat.

39
00:06:13,934 --> 00:06:17,934
I really have no idea what this is supposed to be. Explain it to me!

40
00:06:18,518 --> 00:06:23,518
Maybe you are a goat after all, a beautiful one with horns.

41
00:06:23,518 --> 00:06:30,518
Heidi, the baby goat
- So you know, I'm going to put all the flowers in my bed and
make it as beautiful as the flower meadow here.

42
00:06:30,518 --> 00:06:32,518
Strange idea. Shall we go on now?

43
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:34,518
I'd love to.

44
00:06:38,518 --> 00:06:41,518
What's the name of the pretty bird sitting on the branch?

45
00:06:41,518 --> 00:06:44,518
No idea. Just a pretty bird.

46
00:06:44,518 --> 00:06:46,518
Look, Peter.

47
00:06:47,046 --> 00:06:49,546
What's the name of the animal that was just sitting on the tree?

48
00:06:49,546 --> 00:06:51,546
That's impossible. You don't know that?

49
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:54,546
I've seen it somewhere before.

50
00:06:55,546 --> 00:06:57,546
Peter, there! Quick! That's a rabbit!

51
00:06:59,546 --> 00:07:01,046
What a pity.

52
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,546
Let's go on.

53
00:07:02,546 --> 00:07:04,546
Why did you run away from me?

54
00:07:04,546 --> 00:07:06,546
What do I know why? Come on, finally!

55
00:07:06,546 --> 00:07:08,046
Are we in a hurry?

56
00:07:08,046 --> 00:07:10,046
At some point we want to get to the top.

Look! An eagle is flying up there!

57
00:07:18,224 --> 00:07:22,224
Apparently you don't know anything. That wasn't an eagle, that was a raven.

58
00:07:24,024 --> 00:07:26,024
We're almost there! Come on, quick!

59
00:07:26,024 --> 00:07:26,876
Come on!

Whoever gets to the rock mound first wins!

How beautiful

Is the white stuff snow?
-What else?

60
00:08:19,952 --> 00:08:21,952
The sun never shines down there.

61
00:08:21,952 --> 00:08:24,952
I know something better than to stare into the gorge.

62
00:08:24,952 --> 00:08:25,952
Yes?

63
00:08:25,952 --> 00:08:29,952
I just have to get my flowers safe first, then I'll join you.

64
00:08:30,952 --> 00:08:32,952
I'll put them with the bag.

65
00:08:33,952 --> 00:08:37,952
Wait, I thought you had thought up something we could play.

66
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:40,952
I was definitely not talking about playing.

67
00:08:41,952 --> 00:08:45,952
You said you know something better than to stare into the gorge.

68
00:08:47,472 --> 00:08:50,472
I know, and that's exactly what I'm doing right now.

69
00:08:50,472 --> 00:08:51,472
Sleep?

70
00:08:51,472 --> 00:08:53,472
What else?

71
00:08:53,472 --> 00:08:56,472
Do you know something better than sleeping in the sun?

72
00:08:56,472 --> 00:08:58,472
Sleep.

73
00:08:58,472 --> 00:08:59,472
You lazy bug!

74
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:00,472
Do you know what you are, Peter?

75
00:09:00,472 --> 00:09:02,472
You're terribly boring!

76
00:09:02,472 --> 00:09:04,472
Fine with me.

77
00:09:05,472 --> 00:09:07,472
You don't really want to sleep.

78
00:09:07,472 --> 00:09:08,472
Now I know.

79
00:09:08,472 --> 00:09:09,472
You're just pretending.

80
00:09:09,472 --> 00:09:11,472
You want to prank me.

81
00:09:11,472 --> 00:09:12,472
Peter!

82
00:09:12,472 --> 00:09:14,472
You can't just sleep now.

The raven is coming back!

The other raven was smaller.

Help.

Heidi! Where are you, Heidi?

Say something!

Don't let go!

Quick, he's coming back!

Hold tight.

The big raven up there knocked me from the tree. Wait.

Stay still. I'll help.

Slowly.

83
00:10:30,315 --> 00:10:33,315
Oh, that was close. You were supposed to stay close to me!

84
00:10:33,315 --> 00:10:35,315
I wasn't that far away.

85
00:10:36,315 --> 00:10:39,315
I want to know where the raven is flying.

86
00:10:41,315 --> 00:10:44,315
That's not a raven, that's an eagle.

87
00:10:49,963 --> 00:10:52,363
Oh, I don't care what it is.

88
00:10:52,363 --> 00:10:55,763
It's not irrelevant! A raven wouldn't have thrown you from a tree, would it?

89
00:10:56,863 --> 00:11:00,863
Ok fine, an eagle. I still don't know where it's flying to.

90
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:06,463
You don't even know.

91
00:11:11,243 --> 00:11:16,043
Tell me, do you want to or can't you tell me where the raven is flying to?

92
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:22,243
I actually want to know if where you come from you also used to treat
the other children like you do me.

93
00:11:22,243 --> 00:11:25,243
You speak with one as if they were the last piece of dirt.

94
00:11:25,243 --> 00:11:27,243
Besides, it's an eagle!

Wow, he's sensitive.

95
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,583
That's your cheese! Why don't you eat it?

96
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:44,583
Don't be afraid, you're not going to get sick. Try it, Heidi!

97
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,583
Such a big piece...

98
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,583
Now he swallowed it wrong.

Milk.

Let me try. I'm thirsty.

99
00:12:01,126 --> 00:12:04,126
You can't do this!

100
00:12:04,126 --> 00:12:06,126
Move! Thanks!

101
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:08,126
I wanted to do it, too.

I understand.

Your eyes are as big as wagon wheels.

Take it already. I'm happy to give it to you.

102
00:12:52,934 --> 00:12:55,934
-I can't eat as much as you. Well, take it.

103
00:12:56,434 --> 00:12:59,434
-You're giving me some of your cheese? 
-Yes.

104
00:12:59,434 --> 00:13:02,434
-I don't need it. Take it. 
-Thank you.

105
00:13:03,434 --> 00:13:07,434
-Will you really not want it back? 
-You can eat it.

106
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:21,254
What's the name of the little, colorful goat over there? 
-It's called whatever it looks like.

107
00:13:21,254 --> 00:13:23,254
Then the colorful one is her name.

108
00:13:24,254 --> 00:13:28,254
And the old goat over there? -The old one, quite simply.

109
00:13:29,254 --> 00:13:34,254
Oh, what? What's her name as a little goat? She can't have been old from the
start.

110
00:13:34,254 --> 00:13:37,254
I don't know anymore. Everyone calls her the old one.

111
00:13:38,254 --> 00:13:43,254
What does the colorful one want from the old one? 
-You ask questions, of course play.

112
00:13:49,606 --> 00:13:55,606
The most beautiful is Schnucki. 
-You only imagine that. When they are small, they are all cute.

113
00:13:55,606 --> 00:13:57,606
I find her especially pretty.

114
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:03,606
Did you understand what I said, because you are coming to me now?

Look, over there.

There are marmots.

115
00:14:10,854 --> 00:14:12,854
There are marmots?

116
00:14:12,854 --> 00:14:13,354
Where?

117
00:14:13,354 --> 00:14:14,854
They are gone again.

Stop. Stay still. Come here.

Stay still, you stupid animal.

Wait, I'll help you.

Grab the other leg.

I can't reach. My arms are too short.

Wait.

Here. Take it. Good grass. Nice grass. It's tasty.

Take it already.

That tastes good.

118
00:14:52,422 --> 00:14:54,422
It's a good thing that I'm here!

119
00:14:54,422 --> 00:14:55,090
Yes, and it's a good thing that smarter goats also exist.

You'll never do that again.

Wait! Don't hit her!

120
00:15:05,025 --> 00:15:07,285
How else am I supposed to teach her what she can and can't do?

121
00:15:07,285 --> 00:15:08,285
No, please don't!

122
00:15:09,005 --> 00:15:11,905
If you beat her I will never talk to you again!

123
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:14,865
We are to blame because we didn't pay attention!

124
00:15:14,865 --> 00:15:17,745
Don't worry, Bunte. He is not to do anything to you.

125
00:15:21,605 --> 00:15:24,545
Strange, but all of a sudden I don't want to beat her anymore!

126
00:15:24,545 --> 00:15:27,705
I don't know why, but somehow I'm sorry for her.

127
00:15:27,705 --> 00:15:29,405
You're getting reasonable.

128
00:15:29,405 --> 00:15:32,105
Then you can tell me where the raven is flying to.

129
00:15:32,105 --> 00:15:34,105
What's wrong?

130
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:39,399
Oh, I see. You still haven't thought of where they're flying to, have you?

131
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,399
It was an eagle.

132
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,399
I always get that mixed up.

133
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,399
From now on, no more goats will be beaten, promise?

We need to go home.

Can't we stay a little longer? I still haven't seen the marmots.

134
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:04,889
No. The herd has to be down in the village before the sun sets.

135
00:17:04,889 --> 00:17:09,889
Why? Can't you deliver the goats later, or will no one want them then?

136
00:17:09,889 --> 00:17:12,889
Yes, but I don't want them to break their legs.

137
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:23,089
Peter, Peter, come here quickly.

138
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:25,089
Everything suddenly looks red, like fire.

139
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:29,089
And the peaks are suddenly made of real gold, like royal crowns.

140
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,089
When the sun sets, it's always like that.

141
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:33,089
Then it colors everything glowing red.

142
00:17:33,089 --> 00:17:35,089
Even I like that.

Look, Heidi! He's over there again!

Where?

143
00:17:44,033 --> 00:17:46,033
In the sky, of course.

Oh, my raven.

I give up.

145
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:06,169
For Heidi, this first day she spent with Peter and the herd on the pasture was
like a fairytale.

146
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:09,169
She saw animals she had never heard of before.

147
00:18:09,169 --> 00:18:16,169
And above all, she experienced for the first time the glow of the mountains in
the light of the setting sun.

148
00:18:31,164 --> 00:18:36,164
Now it's over again. Do you think you can see it every evening here in the
mountains?

149
00:18:37,664 --> 00:18:40,164
I would like to see it again.

150
00:18:40,164 --> 00:18:45,164
Don't worry, you will. Sunsets happen almost every evening. Sometimes they are
even more beautiful.

Peter, you forgot something. You still haven't told me where it's flying to.

To it's nest.

151
00:18:54,652 --> 00:18:56,652
Did you know that all this time?

152
00:18:56,652 --> 00:18:58,652
Yes, I did.

153
00:18:58,652 --> 00:19:00,652
And you didn't say anything?

154
00:19:00,652 --> 00:19:01,652
Yes, I did.

155
00:19:01,652 --> 00:19:02,652
Why?

156
00:19:02,652 --> 00:19:05,652
Because you called our beautiful eagle ravens all this time.

Joseph, Grandfather. We're back!

Well, my child. You seem to have enjoyed it.

157
00:19:20,028 --> 00:19:22,028
Your whole face is glowing.

158
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:25,028
Oh yes, grandfather. It was beautiful.

Goodbye, Heidi.

Goodbye. Until tomorrow. Pick me up.

Of course. Until then.

159
00:19:38,812 --> 00:19:44,812
Grandfather, did you know that eagles throw people off the
mountains and ravens don't?

160
00:19:44,812 --> 00:19:47,528
And that you can find flowers everywhere?

161
00:19:53,052 --> 00:19:59,052
What's wrong with them, grandfather? Just look at them. What do they look like?
They were completely different.

162
00:19:59,052 --> 00:20:08,052
You'll have wrapped them in your cloth all day long. Flowers need water. They
need sun, fresh air and water. Without all that, they'll wilt.

163
00:20:10,052 --> 00:20:12,052
I'm sorry for them.

164
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,980
Why do I always do everything wrong?

165
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,980
Heidi was very sad about her flowers.

166
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,980
But after a few minutes, all sadness was gone.

167
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,980
In the evening, after the grandfather had set the table,

168
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,980
she talked and talked again like a waterfall.

169
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,980
She had to describe everything.

170
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,730
Every experience, every detail.

171
00:20:53,730 --> 00:21:05,730
She told about the eagle, the marmots, about Peter, whom she forbade to beat the
goats, and in particular she described the glowing red sunset.

172
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,730
You don't even know how beautiful it is.

173
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:12,730
Yes, Heidi, I know how beautiful it is. That's why I live up here.

174
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:16,730
And I will never move down into the village, not for all the money in the world.

175
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:22,685
Here in the mountains I am free, as free as your eagle you told me about
earlier.

176
00:21:22,685 --> 00:21:28,565
The grandfather was suddenly very serious. He thought of the eagle, thought of
his free, wild,

177
00:21:28,565 --> 00:21:33,565
boundless life. He thought about how people admired him, but also pursued him.

178
00:21:33,565 --> 00:21:38,805
Heidi was shocked. She suddenly realized that her grandfather, who the people

179
00:21:38,805 --> 00:21:41,785
were gossiping about in the village, was very similar to the eagle.

180
00:21:41,785 --> 00:21:44,125
You know what?

181
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:52,245
I'll stay with you from now on. I'll never go away. I always want to live
like you.

183
00:21:52,781 --> 00:21:58,781
And one day I'll be just like you. Just the long beard you have, I don't want
that.

184
00:21:58,781 --> 00:22:05,281
Heidi wanted to get rid of her grandfather's serious thoughts with her remark.
And she succeeded in that.

185
00:22:05,281 --> 00:22:06,781
Are you angry?

186
00:22:06,781 --> 00:22:10,781
No, why should I be angry? I'm sorry if I scared you.

187
00:22:10,781 --> 00:22:14,781
I just had to think of something, but that has nothing to do with you, my child.

188
00:22:15,281 --> 00:22:18,781
So a wonderful day ended for Heidi.

189
00:22:19,149 --> 00:22:27,149
Of course, she tried to delay as long as possible the time when the inevitable
bedtime would take place.

190
00:22:27,149 --> 00:22:31,149
In this she was no different from all other children.

191
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:33,149
But in the end it was time.

192
00:22:33,149 --> 00:22:39,149
She climbed up in her room and was already asleep when her grandfather was 
tucking her in.

193
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:45,149
And she dreamed that night of goats, rocks, mountains and marmots.

194
00:22:52,631 --> 00:22:59,631
The next morning Heidi got up with the sun, and no sooner than she had gotten up,
she was already confusing everything.

195
00:22:59,631 --> 00:23:05,631
On this day she found Piep, and from that hour on there was nothing
else for her.

196
00:23:05,631 --> 00:23:13,631
Piep had fallen out of the nest during a thunderstorm, and Heidi held and cared
for him so long until he became strong and healthy again.

197
00:23:13,631 --> 00:23:20,631
The whole lovely long day she caught flies and mosquitos for him and sometimes
even snails and skinks.

198
00:23:20,845 --> 00:23:27,345
No matter how much she was disgusted by all the little animal stuff she had to
catch, nothing was too much for Piep.

199
00:23:27,345 --> 00:23:30,845
But we want to tell you about that in our next story.
