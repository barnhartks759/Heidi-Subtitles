00:00:24,366 --> 00:00:28,366
Your world are the mountains

Heidi, Heidi

6
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:36,366
Because up here you are at home

7
00:00:36,366 --> 00:00:40,366
Dark firs

8
00:00:40,366 --> 00:00:44,366
Green meadows in the sunshine

Heidi, Heidi

10
00:00:48,366 --> 00:00:52,366
You need to be happy

Come to your home

Find your happiness

19
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:18,366
Come back home

21
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:37,850
We don't have to run like that. The train doesn't leave without us.

22
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:41,850
Stop, Heidi. We have to get in here. This is our department.

23
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:45,850
Come.

24
00:01:51,994 --> 00:01:53,994
There's even a place for a window.

25
00:01:58,266 --> 00:02:00,266
Are there any stones in there?

26
00:02:01,966 --> 00:02:03,966
Shouldn't I put the basket up there too?

27
00:02:03,966 --> 00:02:06,266
No, I won't give you the basket.

28
00:02:06,266 --> 00:02:09,566
Clara put the buns in there for Peter's grandmother.

29
00:02:18,426 --> 00:02:23,426
Oh yes, the buns. That reminds me of your very first evening with us in
Frankfurt.

30
00:02:23,426 --> 00:02:27,426
You quickly grabbed a bun from the table and then hid it in your shirt.

31
00:02:27,426 --> 00:02:28,426
Did you notice that?

32
00:02:28,426 --> 00:02:33,426
Yes, of course. I still have to laugh today when I think about what you always
liked so much.

33
00:02:33,426 --> 00:02:36,426
Just remember the cats like that back then.

34
00:02:36,426 --> 00:02:38,426
She chased them all away back then.

35
00:02:38,426 --> 00:02:41,426
You cried terribly. And I had terrible pity.

36
00:02:41,426 --> 00:02:45,426
That's over now. I don't need any more cats.

37
00:02:45,426 --> 00:02:47,426
Schaffner!

38
00:02:49,338 --> 00:02:53,338
Do you know that the train is going home to the mountains?

39
00:02:53,338 --> 00:02:56,338
Of course, don't be afraid.

40
00:03:03,255 --> 00:03:05,255
We're leaving!

41
00:03:06,255 --> 00:03:09,255
You don't even know how long I've been waiting for this.

42
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:11,255
It's going home!

43
00:03:12,255 --> 00:03:14,255
That must be Heidi's train.

44
00:03:14,255 --> 00:03:16,255
Dad, now she's gone.

45
00:03:16,255 --> 00:03:18,255
Yeah.

46
00:03:21,847 --> 00:03:25,847
For ever. She was like a little sister to me.

47
00:03:25,847 --> 00:03:28,847
It was so beautiful when Heidi was there.

48
00:03:45,271 --> 00:03:48,271
I hope Clara doesn't cry now.

49
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:51,271
We'll see each other again, Clara.

50
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:55,271
I'm sorry I didn't like it.

51
00:03:55,271 --> 00:03:57,271
Everything was so bad.

52
00:04:10,807 --> 00:04:15,807
If you hear such a strange noise, then it's not the train, but my stomach.

53
00:04:15,807 --> 00:04:16,807
I'm hungry.

54
00:04:16,807 --> 00:04:19,807
Me too. Did we bring something to eat?

55
00:04:19,807 --> 00:04:23,807
Not that. The train has a food truck in which we could both go to eat.

56
00:04:23,807 --> 00:04:25,807
Are you hungry, Heidi?

57
00:04:28,807 --> 00:04:32,807
Did Mrs. Rottenmeier actually say goodbye?

58
00:04:33,469 --> 00:04:38,269
I couldn't find her on the street when we got into the car.

59
00:04:38,269 --> 00:04:43,069
But I guess Mr. Sesemann told you the truth, didn't he?

60
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:49,269
Now just say you're done.

61
00:04:49,269 --> 00:04:51,669
But the meat is good. Take some more.

62
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:53,069
You, Sebastian?

63
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:54,069
Yeah?

64
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:56,669
We have to be there soon, don't we?

65
00:04:57,669 --> 00:04:59,669
It'll take a while.

66
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:03,069
Don't you remember your ride?

67
00:05:03,245 --> 00:05:05,245
Oh, good.

68
00:05:06,745 --> 00:05:08,745
We have to change again.

69
00:05:08,745 --> 00:05:09,745
What?

70
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:14,745
Well, you know, you can hardly expect to be home again.

71
00:05:15,745 --> 00:05:18,745
I'm so happy. I'm so incredibly happy.

72
00:05:33,245 --> 00:05:34,519
To be continued...

73
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:36,519
It can't take long now.

74
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:40,519
Will we be there soon?

75
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:41,519
Okay.

76
00:05:50,359 --> 00:05:54,359
Don't run like that again. We have half an hour to get around.

77
00:05:56,359 --> 00:05:58,359
Our train is already here!

79
00:06:10,836 --> 00:06:13,836
But Heidi, it still takes hours for us to be there.

80
00:06:13,836 --> 00:06:15,836
You haven't slept a second yet.

81
00:06:15,836 --> 00:06:17,836
I can sleep at home.

83
00:06:49,908 --> 00:06:53,908
Heidi, wake up. There are only two stations to Mayenfeld.

84
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:03,220
There are my mountains! Sebastian, look!

85
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,060
Not at all. I'm starting to understand you.

86
00:07:15,008 --> 00:07:17,008
I'm starting to understand you.

87
00:07:42,008 --> 00:07:44,008
These are my mountains.

88
00:07:44,008 --> 00:07:46,008
Finally I'm back home.

89
00:08:08,008 --> 00:08:11,008
Mayenfeld! Mayenfeld!

90
00:08:11,008 --> 00:08:13,008
Pascal, I'm back home!

91
00:08:15,008 --> 00:08:17,008
Oh, is everything still as it was?

92
00:08:17,008 --> 00:08:19,008
Yes! Hurray!

93
00:08:19,008 --> 00:08:21,008
Slowly, Heidi!

94
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,008
We have to go this way, Sebastian!

95
00:08:38,008 --> 00:08:40,008
The way over there leads up to Dörfli.

96
00:08:40,008 --> 00:08:42,008
Come on, Sebastian, come on!

97
00:08:44,008 --> 00:08:46,008
There are waterfalls everywhere!

98
00:08:46,008 --> 00:08:47,008
Let's go!

99
00:08:50,008 --> 00:08:51,008
Let's go!

100
00:08:51,008 --> 00:08:53,008
We have to go this way!

101
00:08:58,008 --> 00:08:58,097
Something has been going on downstairs.

102
00:08:58,097 --> 00:09:02,097
Heidi, slowly, I can't stand it anymore.

103
00:09:02,097 --> 00:09:04,097
It's impossible.

104
00:09:11,793 --> 00:09:15,793
Please stop. Could you take something with us?

105
00:09:17,793 --> 00:09:18,793
From me, Gern.

106
00:09:18,793 --> 00:09:20,793
Thank you. I'll show myself.

107
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:24,793
Well, get on. You're probably not used to our mountains.

108
00:09:24,793 --> 00:09:27,793
You say so. We can go with you.

109
00:09:27,793 --> 00:09:28,793
Oh yes!

110
00:09:41,073 --> 00:09:44,073
Do you know that for the first time in my life I'm in the mountains?

111
00:09:44,073 --> 00:09:45,073
Hard to believe.

112
00:09:45,073 --> 00:09:48,073
Yes, and certainly very impressive for you.

113
00:09:48,073 --> 00:09:51,073
Do you want to go on vacation here or visit friends?

114
00:09:51,073 --> 00:09:53,073
Neither of the two. I only accompanied the child.

115
00:09:53,073 --> 00:09:55,073
There, Sebastian! Over there is Duffy!

116
00:09:55,073 --> 00:09:56,073
Look!

117
00:10:01,073 --> 00:10:04,073
Hurray! We're there! I'm home!

118
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:06,529
Go away, sit down.

119
00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:09,929
But Sebastian, why aren't you holding on?

120
00:10:09,929 --> 00:10:11,629
You can guess three times.

121
00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:14,029
I thought you might want to jump off.

122
00:10:16,429 --> 00:10:17,929
Sebastian.

123
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:19,929
Over there, that's the church tower.

124
00:10:19,929 --> 00:10:22,529
And over there, that's the way up to our hut.

125
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:24,529
But you can't see it yet.

126
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:28,029
Even steeper.

127
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:30,391
Well, just say, we have to go up now.

128
00:10:30,391 --> 00:10:32,391
Ah, now I remember.

129
00:10:32,391 --> 00:10:32,891
What?

130
00:10:32,891 --> 00:10:37,891
You could be the little girl that the Almöhi had picked up. What was your name
again?

131
00:10:37,891 --> 00:10:38,391
Heidi.

132
00:10:38,391 --> 00:10:45,391
Heidi, yes, yes, now I remember again. Heidi is the little one. You should have
been in Frankfurt, they say.

133
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:48,391
Why did you actually come back?

134
00:10:48,391 --> 00:10:51,891
Quite simply, I wanted to. I like it here better than in the city.

135
00:10:51,891 --> 00:10:53,391
You must have been homesick.

136
00:10:53,391 --> 00:10:54,891
Yes, and how.

137
00:10:54,891 --> 00:10:56,891
Don't fall asleep, Lise.

138
00:10:57,143 --> 00:11:00,143
Do you know my grandfather, because you know so much?

139
00:11:00,143 --> 00:11:03,143
Of course I do. Who doesn't know him?

140
00:11:03,143 --> 00:11:06,143
He used to always bring me the bread.

141
00:11:06,143 --> 00:11:07,143
A long time ago.

142
00:11:07,143 --> 00:11:09,143
And why doesn't he bring it now?

143
00:11:09,143 --> 00:11:12,143
Because we had a fight. But it's no wonder.

144
00:11:15,143 --> 00:11:17,143
Why is that no wonder?

145
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:19,143
Because he's getting more and more strange.

146
00:11:19,143 --> 00:11:21,143
I mean, he's always been a bit strange.

147
00:11:21,607 --> 00:11:24,607
But lately it hasn't been as strange as it used to be.

148
00:11:24,607 --> 00:11:27,607
That's right. My grandfather isn't strange at all. He's very nice.

149
00:11:27,607 --> 00:11:30,607
Nice? I hear that for the first time.

150
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,607
Gross!

151
00:11:51,607 --> 00:11:53,607
Sebastian!

152
00:11:57,073 --> 00:11:59,073
There's Snuggie's stable!

153
00:11:59,073 --> 00:12:01,573
I can't wait to see her again!

154
00:12:01,573 --> 00:12:04,073
Snuggie? Is that one of your girlfriends?

155
00:12:04,073 --> 00:12:08,073
Snuggie, I always liked you the most of all. She's my favorite goat.

156
00:12:08,073 --> 00:12:10,073
Excuse me? A goat?

157
00:12:17,262 --> 00:12:19,262
End of the line.

158
00:12:19,262 --> 00:12:21,262
That's far enough.

159
00:12:21,262 --> 00:12:23,262
There's my fountain.

160
00:12:23,262 --> 00:12:25,262
Good thing he's still there.

161
00:12:25,262 --> 00:12:27,262
Good thing I met you.

162
00:12:27,262 --> 00:12:29,262
I could never have gone on foot.

163
00:12:29,262 --> 00:12:31,262
Sebastian!

164
00:12:31,262 --> 00:12:33,262
Thank you very much.

165
00:12:33,262 --> 00:12:35,262
You're welcome.

166
00:12:35,262 --> 00:12:37,262
Do you know someone who can take Heidi to her grandfather?

167
00:12:37,262 --> 00:12:39,262
If I do it myself, I won't be able to reach the train anymore.

168
00:12:39,262 --> 00:12:41,262
I can go alone.

169
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:43,262
I don't need anyone to accompany me.

170
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,262
And the suitcase? The grandfather can get it.

171
00:12:46,638 --> 00:12:48,638
Do you think he'll do it?

172
00:12:48,638 --> 00:12:50,638
If I ask him to, he'll do it for sure.

173
00:12:50,638 --> 00:12:52,638
Good, if you think so.

174
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:54,638
I'll open it.

175
00:12:54,638 --> 00:12:56,638
Goodbye, Sebastian.

176
00:12:56,638 --> 00:12:58,638
And thank you for bringing it.

177
00:12:58,638 --> 00:13:00,638
Heidi?

178
00:13:00,638 --> 00:13:02,638
Yes?

179
00:13:02,638 --> 00:13:04,638
Live well, Heidi. Take care.

180
00:13:04,638 --> 00:13:06,638
You can come to visit us whenever you want.

181
00:13:06,638 --> 00:13:08,638
It could be that you don't like it here anymore.

182
00:13:08,638 --> 00:13:10,638
That can never be in life.

183
00:13:10,638 --> 00:13:12,638
Sebastian?

184
00:13:12,638 --> 00:13:14,638
Please say a nice greeting to Clara and thank you again.

185
00:13:15,508 --> 00:13:22,508
And when the grandmother comes to visit again to Frankfurt, then tell her that I
like her very, very much. And Mr. Sesemann too.

186
00:13:22,508 --> 00:13:25,508
Goodbye, Heidi. Please take care of yourself.

187
00:13:25,508 --> 00:13:28,508
Goodbye. Live well!

188
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:31,508
Goodbye, Heidi. Goodbye.

189
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,982
That's Heidi from Almöhn.

190
00:13:38,982 --> 00:13:40,982
No, that's not to believe, Heidi!

191
00:13:40,982 --> 00:13:43,982
Good day! Since when have you been back from Frankfurt?

192
00:13:43,982 --> 00:13:45,982
Since just now, goodbye!

193
00:13:45,982 --> 00:13:47,982
She's wearing an odd dress.

194
00:13:47,982 --> 00:13:49,982
And he's wearing a hat to scream.

195
00:13:49,982 --> 00:13:51,982
She looks like a city child.

196
00:13:51,982 --> 00:13:53,982
Maybe she has school holidays and is visiting.

197
00:13:53,982 --> 00:13:55,982
I want to know what the old man says.

198
00:13:55,982 --> 00:13:58,982
I can't imagine that he knows it.

199
00:13:58,982 --> 00:14:01,982
He hasn't received a single letter in the last few days.

203
00:15:02,187 --> 00:15:05,187
You can look all the way into the valley.

204
00:15:05,187 --> 00:15:10,187
You can look all the way into the valley, all the way.

205
00:15:13,187 --> 00:15:17,187
If he had gone up, all the buns would have rolled into the valley.

206
00:15:18,187 --> 00:15:20,187
What a bunny!

207
00:15:20,187 --> 00:15:23,187
Come here, say good day, I'm back!

208
00:15:29,187 --> 00:15:30,187
No!

209
00:15:30,443 --> 00:15:32,443
I won't do anything to you!

210
00:15:41,547 --> 00:15:43,547
The hut! Peter is at home!

211
00:15:43,547 --> 00:15:45,547
Yes! Grandmother!

212
00:15:46,547 --> 00:15:48,547
Grandmother! Grandmother!

213
00:16:01,547 --> 00:16:03,547
There she is!

214
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,171
Who came?

215
00:16:10,171 --> 00:16:14,171
That's how Heidi always came in. But she can't be.

216
00:16:14,171 --> 00:16:17,171
Why can't Heidi be?

217
00:16:23,171 --> 00:16:27,171
I'm home again! Grandmother, I'm back!

218
00:16:28,171 --> 00:16:30,171
Aren't you happy?

219
00:16:30,411 --> 00:16:32,411
My heathens!

220
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:36,411
Believe it, it's me!

221
00:16:37,411 --> 00:16:39,411
Good day, Grandmother!

222
00:16:43,371 --> 00:16:49,371
Heidi is back. Our little Heidi, that I can still experience that.

223
00:16:49,371 --> 00:16:54,371
I am so happy, Grandmother. I would like to scream loudly.

224
00:16:54,371 --> 00:16:58,371
Then just scream. No one is there except the two of us.

225
00:16:58,371 --> 00:17:02,371
My child, you have to tell me exactly what you have experienced.

226
00:17:06,371 --> 00:17:11,371
Now I have to start crying.

227
00:17:11,937 --> 00:17:13,937
Grandmother, don't cry, okay?

228
00:17:13,937 --> 00:17:16,937
Please. Now I'm back and I'll never go away again.

229
00:17:16,937 --> 00:17:18,937
Definitely not, Grandmother.

230
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:21,937
Even that! Now I almost forgot!

231
00:17:21,937 --> 00:17:24,937
Heidi, what is it?

232
00:17:30,187 --> 00:17:34,187
I brought you something. Guess what I have in my hand.

233
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:39,187
No, I'd rather tell you. It's a very soft, white bun.

234
00:17:39,187 --> 00:17:45,187
Heidi, I can feel it. It's really a bun. I'll let myself taste it.

235
00:17:49,187 --> 00:17:51,187
You're a sweet child, Heidi.

236
00:17:51,187 --> 00:17:52,187
There's more!

237
00:17:52,187 --> 00:17:54,187
What? Even more? But Heidi!

238
00:17:56,187 --> 00:17:58,187
Did you mean that when you were talking about it?

239
00:17:58,187 --> 00:17:59,187
Very well.

240
00:18:06,408 --> 00:18:09,408
Is it good?

241
00:18:09,408 --> 00:18:11,408
It is delicious.

242
00:18:11,408 --> 00:18:15,408
I can not remember when I last ate such a good bread.

243
00:18:15,408 --> 00:18:17,408
Nice.

244
00:18:17,408 --> 00:18:19,408
Wait, I'll get you the others.

245
00:18:22,408 --> 00:18:23,408
There.

246
00:18:23,408 --> 00:18:24,408
What? So many?

247
00:18:24,408 --> 00:18:26,408
There are even more in the suitcase.

248
00:18:26,408 --> 00:18:29,408
Heidi, thank you, Heidi, thank you very much.

249
00:18:30,248 --> 00:18:38,248
That was a very nice surprise from you, but most of all I am happy that you have
finally come home to us again, child.

250
00:18:38,248 --> 00:18:42,248
That is more beautiful than all the rolls in the world. Thank you, Heidi.

251
00:18:42,248 --> 00:18:45,248
Oh no! That's Heidi!

252
00:18:45,248 --> 00:18:47,248
Good day, Brigitte! I'm back!

253
00:18:47,248 --> 00:18:48,248
Heidi!

254
00:18:48,248 --> 00:18:51,248
Yes, imagine, she suddenly came in the door.

255
00:18:52,248 --> 00:18:58,248
Good day, Heidi. That's unbelievable. You are hardly recognizable.

256
00:18:58,478 --> 00:19:01,358
You have become an elegant lady.

257
00:19:01,358 --> 00:19:04,978
You should see her dress, Grandmother.

258
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:07,238
And first the pretty hat.

259
00:19:07,238 --> 00:19:09,958
Please put it on. I want to see how it looks.

260
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:13,318
I can't start with such a hat. You can keep it if you want.

261
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,698
Heidi,

262
00:19:14,698 --> 00:19:17,638
I can't just keep this good hat.

263
00:19:17,638 --> 00:19:20,238
But of course. I don't like it.

264
00:19:20,238 --> 00:19:21,138
Heidi.

265
00:19:21,138 --> 00:19:23,438
Finally. You can keep that too.

266
00:19:23,438 --> 00:19:26,438
Why? It's very pretty. You can wear it well.

267
00:19:26,438 --> 00:19:27,486
I know, it's...

268
00:19:27,486 --> 00:19:31,486
It's a pretty dress, but I'd rather go up the hill to my grandfather.

269
00:19:31,486 --> 00:19:33,486
I want him to recognize me right away.

270
00:19:33,486 --> 00:19:37,486
So, I just want to put this hat on and no one else.

271
00:19:37,486 --> 00:19:39,486
That's how I like it. That's how it's right.

272
00:19:39,486 --> 00:19:41,486
Goodbye, Grandmother.

273
00:19:41,486 --> 00:19:45,486
Goodbye, my child. Will you promise me that you will come back as soon as
possible?

274
00:19:45,486 --> 00:19:46,486
Yes.

275
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:48,486
Goodbye, Heidi. Be careful.

276
00:19:48,486 --> 00:19:50,486
Goodbye.

277
00:19:50,486 --> 00:19:53,486
I completely forgot what kind of sweet little thing she is.

278
00:19:53,486 --> 00:19:55,470
I'm glad she came back.

279
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:58,470
What do you think will make the Almöy happy first?

280
00:20:29,316 --> 00:20:31,316
we'll see

281
00:20:41,316 --> 00:20:43,316
Hooray, Dad!

282
00:20:59,316 --> 00:21:01,316
Joseph!

283
00:21:29,316 --> 00:21:31,316
No!

284
00:21:37,316 --> 00:21:39,316
Heidi!

285
00:21:50,316 --> 00:21:52,316
Grandfather!

286
00:21:53,316 --> 00:21:55,316
Grandfather!

287
00:21:59,316 --> 00:22:01,316
Grandfather!

288
00:22:01,316 --> 00:22:03,316
Heidi!

289
00:22:03,316 --> 00:22:05,316
Heidi, Heidi, Heidi!

290
00:22:05,316 --> 00:22:07,316
Finally!

291
00:22:07,316 --> 00:22:09,316
Everything is all right again.

292
00:22:29,316 --> 00:22:31,316
To be continued

293
00:22:51,461 --> 00:22:54,461
At this moment, Heidi had been dreaming for so long.

294
00:22:54,461 --> 00:22:57,461
She had painted a thousand times how it would be

295
00:22:57,461 --> 00:23:00,461
if she could finally see her beloved grandfather again.

296
00:23:00,461 --> 00:23:04,461
And now that it was so far, she could only cry.

297
00:23:04,461 --> 00:23:09,461
And all the beautiful words that she had learned by heart were forgotten.

298
00:23:11,461 --> 00:23:18,461
But soon the tears were over and Heidi began to look at the right one, as she
called it.

299
00:23:18,461 --> 00:23:20,155
But that...

300
00:23:20,155 --> 00:23:24,145
We want to tell you in our next story.

301
00:23:24,145 --> 00:23:32,645
Heidi, Heidi, your world are the mountains.

302
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:40,645
Heidi, Heidi, because up here you are at home.

303
00:23:40,645 --> 00:23:46,645
Heidi, Heidi, come home.

304
00:23:46,645 --> 00:23:53,645
Find your happiness, come back home.

305
00:23:54,145 --> 00:23:57,145
To be continued
