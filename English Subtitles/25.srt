Holadio

00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,590
Heidi, Heidi

4
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:28,590
Your world are the mountains

5
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,590
Heidi, Heidi

6
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:36,590
Because up here you are at the top

7
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:40,590
Dark firs

8
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,590
Green meadows in the sunshine

9
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:48,590
Heidi, Heidi

10
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,590
You need to be happy

Holadio, Holadio, Holadio

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,590
Holadio, Holadio, Holadio

00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,590
Holadio, Holadio, Holadio

21
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,590
Holadio, Holadio, Holadio

Holadio, Holadio, Holadio

Holadio, Holadio, Holadio

24
00:01:20,634 --> 00:01:29,634
Every night Heidi dreamed of her favorite dream, because no one can forbid
dreams, not even Miss Rottenmeier.

25
00:01:29,634 --> 00:01:33,634
Good morning, Peter. Here are more rolls.

26
00:01:35,634 --> 00:01:39,634
Are these the rolls you told me about, Grandmother?

27
00:01:39,634 --> 00:01:44,634
Yes, my child, that's what I imagined them to be. I always dreamed of them. Now
I can at least bite them properly.

28
00:01:44,634 --> 00:01:47,634
My roll tastes like raspberry jam.

29
00:01:47,634 --> 00:01:49,634
I'll try to see how it tastes.

30
00:01:50,634 --> 00:01:53,634
I'll try to see how it tastes.

31
00:01:59,066 --> 00:02:02,066
Mine tastes like sausage with cream.

32
00:02:12,954 --> 00:02:14,954
How many times do I have to knock?

33
00:02:14,954 --> 00:02:16,954
Good morning, Tinette.

34
00:02:16,954 --> 00:02:18,954
Don't be late for breakfast again.

35
00:02:20,954 --> 00:02:22,954
Miss Rottenmeier is in a terrible mood.

36
00:02:24,954 --> 00:02:26,954
Since you left, what's going on here?

37
00:02:26,954 --> 00:02:28,954
And of course she lets that out on us.

38
00:02:28,954 --> 00:02:30,954
Terrible.

39
00:02:35,802 --> 00:02:37,802
My buns!

40
00:02:39,802 --> 00:02:41,802
My buns!

41
00:02:56,954 --> 00:03:02,954
I really have a lot of trouble with the child, you can confirm that, but I'm
just not done with her.

42
00:03:02,954 --> 00:03:07,954
Maybe she's not normal, I'm sure. Yes, that's the only explanation.

43
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:09,954
What do you say to that?

44
00:03:09,954 --> 00:03:14,954
Unfortunately, the question is not as easy to answer as you might think, Miss
Rottenmeier.

45
00:03:14,954 --> 00:03:17,508
On the one hand, she is normal, on the other hand, not.

46
00:03:17,508 --> 00:03:20,748
When you talk to her like that, she makes a reasonable impression.

47
00:03:20,748 --> 00:03:25,588
She is also very awake, but it just makes me sceptical that she still hasn't
learned the alphabet.

48
00:03:25,588 --> 00:03:27,748
I'm asking you, at her age.

49
00:03:27,748 --> 00:03:31,888
Strange. That fits the impression I have of her again.

50
00:03:31,888 --> 00:03:35,588
Without a doubt. She understands quickly and is also extraordinarily independent
for her age.

51
00:03:35,588 --> 00:03:38,468
But the alphabet, the alphabet!

52
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:42,568
I'm asking you, at the age of eight, you have to be able to distinguish A from
B.

53
00:03:42,568 --> 00:03:46,168
That's what I've been thinking about all this time.

54
00:03:46,212 --> 00:03:47,972
I'm afraid my first impression is right.

55
00:03:47,972 --> 00:03:50,212
She's not the right way to treat Mrs. Clara.

56
00:03:55,692 --> 00:03:57,692
Calm down.

57
00:03:59,432 --> 00:04:02,692
You have to think about yourself and your health first and foremost.

58
00:04:02,692 --> 00:04:05,532
It doesn't make sense for you to ruin yourself for a stranger's child.

59
00:04:07,132 --> 00:04:10,232
If you go on like this, you'll ruin Clara's education.

60
00:04:10,772 --> 00:04:15,132
My years of work, goodwill, efforts and worries, all for nothing.

61
00:04:16,212 --> 00:04:17,982
To be continued...

62
00:04:17,982 --> 00:04:20,982
Is there poison in the coffee?

63
00:04:20,982 --> 00:04:22,982
I've spoiled it.

64
00:04:22,982 --> 00:04:25,982
I've made mistakes. I was way too soft.

65
00:04:25,982 --> 00:04:27,982
Well, no. I wouldn't do that.

66
00:04:27,982 --> 00:04:29,982
Just like this.

67
00:04:29,982 --> 00:04:41,982
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I.

68
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:45,572
And J, and K, and L.

69
00:04:45,572 --> 00:04:48,472
Up to this point, we can do it. Very good, my child.

70
00:04:48,572 --> 00:04:50,572
And now, Adelheid, open your book.

71
00:04:52,072 --> 00:04:53,572
This time, I won't give you a hint.

72
00:04:53,672 --> 00:04:55,772
This time, you'll have to be able to read it by yourself.

73
00:04:55,872 --> 00:04:57,072
So, what is this?

74
00:04:59,172 --> 00:05:00,172
A.

75
00:05:00,372 --> 00:05:02,572
Very good. And now, the next letter.

76
00:05:02,672 --> 00:05:03,672
B.

77
00:05:03,772 --> 00:05:04,772
Very good, my child.

78
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:07,272
And now, let's look for these letters here.

79
00:05:07,572 --> 00:05:08,572
Z.

80
00:05:10,872 --> 00:05:11,872
X?

81
00:05:13,472 --> 00:05:14,472
P.

82
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:17,708
This is the Z and this is the X.

83
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:20,708
I'm afraid you're still messing with them.

84
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,708
Nobility, nobility.

85
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:29,708
So open your notebook and write down all the letters in the book.

86
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:32,708
And the ones you don't finish, you write down ten times.

87
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:33,708
I'm done.

88
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,708
Then show me.

89
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,708
Very nice. Very neat. Good handwriting.

90
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,708
Let's go over to the calculator now.

91
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,708
How many are ten times ten?

92
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,708
A hundred.

93
00:05:45,284 --> 00:05:48,284
From a hundred, please subtract twenty.

94
00:05:48,284 --> 00:05:50,284
Eighty.

95
00:05:50,284 --> 00:05:52,284
To eighty, add nine.

96
00:05:52,284 --> 00:05:53,284
Psst, don't say anything.

97
00:05:53,284 --> 00:05:56,284
From this sum you subtract ten again.

98
00:05:56,284 --> 00:05:58,284
It looks exactly like my stone castle.

99
00:05:58,284 --> 00:06:00,284
Psst, Heidi, not so loud.

100
00:06:03,284 --> 00:06:05,284
Where did we stop?

101
00:06:05,284 --> 00:06:07,284
Yes, there...

102
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,600
It looks exactly like it.

103
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,400
Like the Steinbock I saw in the mountains.

104
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,600
Yes, well, take the written homework, Clara.

105
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,600
Page 12 in your book.

106
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,600
Heidi! Heidi!

107
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,600
Subtitles by the Amara.org community

108
00:06:44,866 --> 00:06:47,866
Do you actually hear what I'm saying?

109
00:06:49,198 --> 00:06:51,198
Oh!

110
00:07:09,198 --> 00:07:11,198
Goodbye!

111
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:13,198
I'll never come back! I'm flying home!

112
00:07:41,198 --> 00:07:43,198
I'm flying home!

113
00:07:47,198 --> 00:07:49,198
Hurray!

114
00:07:54,198 --> 00:07:57,198
Goodbye and thank you!

115
00:07:59,198 --> 00:08:02,198
Live well and greet my Clara!

116
00:08:02,198 --> 00:08:04,198
Goodbye and thank you!

117
00:08:04,198 --> 00:08:06,198
Very nice, Clara! Very nice, that you did that today!

118
00:08:06,198 --> 00:08:08,198
Amazing how fast you do research!

119
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,198
Goodbye!

120
00:08:12,198 --> 00:08:15,198
And greet my Clara!

121
00:08:15,198 --> 00:08:17,198
Thank you for letting me fly with you!

122
00:08:17,198 --> 00:08:18,198
That's not normal!

123
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:20,198
Greet Clara!

124
00:08:20,198 --> 00:08:22,198
But not Mrs. Rottenmeier!

125
00:08:24,198 --> 00:08:25,198
Hello!

126
00:08:27,198 --> 00:08:28,130
Stop it!

127
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,130
What's going on?

128
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,130
Mrs. Rottenmeier!

129
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,130
You fell off the chair!

130
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,130
Did you break your legs?

131
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,130
Do you have pain?

132
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,130
No, I have to help you!

133
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,130
Let me help you!

134
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,130
Oh!

135
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,130
Psst!

136
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,130
Oh!

137
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,130
I dreamed!

138
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,130
Oh!

139
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,130
With open eyes, with a...

140
00:08:42,402 --> 00:08:44,402
On a bright day, can you dream like that?

141
00:08:44,402 --> 00:08:47,402
Yes, very good. Why should you only dream in the dark?

142
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,402
Out of the letters became SteinbÃ¶ck.

143
00:08:51,402 --> 00:08:55,402
What did I tell you this morning? I was right, she's just not normal.

144
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:57,402
Yes?

145
00:08:57,402 --> 00:08:59,402
Come in, Sebastian!

146
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:09,550
Ah, Mr. Sesemann is coming home. Very good. Then this nightmare will probably
come to an end.

147
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,550
When is Father coming home? Is it written in the telegram when he is coming?

148
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,550
He writes in the course of tomorrow's morning.

149
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:18,550
Finally, Father is coming home. And tomorrow, already tomorrow morning.

150
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:22,550
Excuse me, Mr. Candidate. I still have a lot of preparations to make.

151
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,550
Of course.

152
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:38,710
You don't believe how happy I am. I'm sure you'll like my father too. He's very
nice.

153
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:42,710
But most of the time he'll unpack his suitcases and pack them back in.

154
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,710
The last time he disappointed me too.

155
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,710
Why?

156
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:50,710
Oh, you know, he only stayed for three days. He said he'd stay longer.

157
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:55,710
But then this stupid telegram came from Paris and he immediately drove back
home.

158
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,710
If only I could go with him.

159
00:09:58,188 --> 00:10:03,188
You know, Heidi, my father is really nice. When he's here, it's always much
nicer here in the house.

160
00:10:03,188 --> 00:10:06,188
He always tells funny stories about his travels.

161
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:09,188
If you want, you can tell him one of your stories.

162
00:10:09,188 --> 00:10:12,188
He likes to hear things like that, if he has time for it, of course.

163
00:10:12,188 --> 00:10:14,188
But he hardly has time for that.

164
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,750
Does your father love you?

165
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:26,750
I mean, does he love you as much as fathers love their children?

166
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,750
Of course he loves me. Even very much.

167
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,750
Yes? And how do you know that he loves you very much?

168
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,750
He has often told me that he loves me.

169
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,750
He has also written it to me in a letter.

170
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:42,750
And every time he comes home, he brings me presents.

171
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:46,460
But... no, no.

172
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:50,460
That's not true. I know it because I love him from the bottom of my heart.

173
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,460
I love him and my father loves me just as much.

174
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,460
How nice.

175
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,460
You're going to be right.

176
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,460
As always.

177
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,460
I'm curious about your father.

178
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,460
He probably didn't tell you too much.

179
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:22,460
Come here, Tinette! On the spot!

180
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,460
Yes, Mrs. Rottenmeier, what is it?

181
00:11:24,582 --> 00:11:28,182
Come here and take a look at the windows. Do you think they're clean?

182
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:31,782
I haven't cleaned them yet, madam.

183
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:34,182
I should clean Mr. Sesemann's room first.

184
00:11:34,382 --> 00:11:36,582
Should I clean the window first or the room?

185
00:11:36,782 --> 00:11:39,582
Oh, of course, Mr. Sesemann's room first.

186
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:40,782
The windows can wait.

187
00:11:40,982 --> 00:11:41,982
All right.

188
00:11:43,182 --> 00:11:44,382
You have to clean his bed.

189
00:11:44,582 --> 00:11:46,982
That's already done. You don't have to remind me of that.

190
00:11:50,782 --> 00:11:51,982
Always at the last minute.

191
00:11:52,182 --> 00:11:54,382
He could have sent the telegram earlier.

192
00:11:54,582 --> 00:11:55,196
All right.

193
00:11:55,196 --> 00:12:01,196
He could take care of his household a little more, I think, anyway.

194
00:12:01,196 --> 00:12:05,196
Oh, now I would have forgotten the most important thing about my hair in front
of all the excitement.

195
00:12:05,196 --> 00:12:08,196
He probably also wants to see the room of this child.

196
00:12:08,196 --> 00:12:11,196
And with her you have to be focused on everything. Maybe she sleeps on the
floor.

197
00:12:11,196 --> 00:12:14,196
Everything is possible with her.

198
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:17,966
WASH YOUR HAIR

199
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:39,966
Wash your hair!

200
00:12:44,966 --> 00:12:46,966
WASH YOUR HAIR

201
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:58,090
You seem to be able to keep order at least. Well, at least one good page.

202
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:19,090
Oh, embalming!

203
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:24,586
Oh, embalming!

204
00:13:24,586 --> 00:13:26,586
Oh, I hope it's a dream!

205
00:13:26,586 --> 00:13:27,586
Bride!

206
00:13:27,586 --> 00:13:28,586
Christmas!

207
00:13:28,586 --> 00:13:29,586
Bride!

208
00:13:29,586 --> 00:13:31,586
I don't trust my eyes!

209
00:13:37,514 --> 00:13:39,514
Is something wrong?

210
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:55,194
that I don't have a single thing left if it had been Seisemann.

211
00:13:56,118 --> 00:14:00,118
Leave them alone, they're mine! Don't touch them!

212
00:14:00,118 --> 00:14:01,118
Don't touch them!

213
00:14:01,118 --> 00:14:02,118
No!

214
00:14:02,118 --> 00:14:04,118
Leave them alone and stop screaming!

215
00:14:07,118 --> 00:14:10,118
They're mine, I want to give them to my grandmother!

216
00:14:11,118 --> 00:14:14,118
They're the most precious things for my grandmother!

217
00:14:16,118 --> 00:14:19,118
You'll be burned on the spot, you must be poisoned!

218
00:14:19,118 --> 00:14:20,118
No!

219
00:14:20,118 --> 00:14:21,118
I'll find you tomorrow morning!

220
00:14:21,118 --> 00:14:23,118
They're mine, I won't do it anymore!

221
00:14:23,118 --> 00:14:27,118
No, Ms. Rottmeier, don't beat them, they can't do anything about it, let them
go!

222
00:14:27,146 --> 00:14:30,646
I already know that you and her are in a relationship, so stay out of it!

223
00:14:30,646 --> 00:14:33,646
No! No! No!

224
00:14:33,646 --> 00:14:37,646
My patience is at its end, I'll tell you that tomorrow at 6 o'clock!

225
00:14:37,646 --> 00:14:42,646
He'll know what steps he has to take and what I advise him, I already know that!

226
00:14:43,646 --> 00:14:46,646
I don't care, I want my brother back!

227
00:14:46,698 --> 00:14:49,698
There was no reason. You can't eat the buns for a long time.

228
00:14:49,698 --> 00:14:52,698
But they were very nice. I took them all off the table.

229
00:14:52,698 --> 00:14:56,698
They must have been old. Old buns become hard of stone. You can't eat them
anymore.

230
00:14:56,698 --> 00:14:59,698
I'm sorry, but this time Mrs. Rottenmeier was right.

231
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:02,698
They must have been completely moldy and stung.

232
00:15:03,698 --> 00:15:07,698
Then it was all for nothing. Then I was in Frankfurt for nothing all the time.

233
00:15:09,668 --> 00:15:15,268
Heidi, when you go back home, I'll give you a huge cup of fresh bread.

234
00:15:15,268 --> 00:15:20,068
Nice new white bread. No old, rotten, stone-hard bread that no one can eat
anymore.

235
00:15:20,068 --> 00:15:21,868
And stop crying, Heidi.

236
00:15:21,868 --> 00:15:24,068
No, no, nothing will change.

237
00:15:24,068 --> 00:15:27,068
I'm never allowed to go home after all.

238
00:15:27,068 --> 00:15:31,068
Who says that? Of course you can go home at some point.

239
00:15:31,068 --> 00:15:34,868
You're just angry because of the bread, but you can't just put it away.

240
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:38,660
Believe me, when it's time, we'll buy a new one.

241
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,660
Why are you crying now?

242
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,660
Heidilein, did I say something wrong?

243
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:46,660
I'm doing everything wrong and no one listens to me when I want to explain
something.

244
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,660
No one can suffer me and everything I like is taken away from me.

245
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:53,660
I only ate one bun every morning and no one did anything to Mama.

246
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:57,660
They will never let me go home in life, just because they know that I want it.

247
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,660
Heidi, stay here!

248
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,660
No!

249
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:26,270
I'm about to cry too.

250
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:29,270
I'm sorry, but I can't do anything about it.

251
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:35,270
Come with me to my room. I'll come up with something we can play.

252
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:38,270
I recently gave you a picture book card with a cat on it.

253
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,270
I'll give you the other one too, okay?

254
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,270
You liked them very much.

255
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,270
Come.

256
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:48,270
I also know a story about goats. If you want, I can tell you.

257
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:51,270
It's an exciting story. You'll definitely like it.

258
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,270
I'll give it to you too.

259
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,270
I love you!

260
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,270
I'm really sorry.

261
00:17:22,286 --> 00:17:28,286
I'll tell you. You listen very well. I know the story of my father. He once told
her.

262
00:17:29,286 --> 00:17:36,286
Once upon a time, a long, long time ago, there lived in a deep, dark forest in a
pretty, small, colorful house,

263
00:17:36,286 --> 00:17:42,286
a mother goat with seven white chicks. The mother goat loved her chicks very
much and raised them well.

264
00:17:43,286 --> 00:17:47,286
One day, the mother goat put on her white gloves,

265
00:17:48,286 --> 00:17:50,052
took the bag,

266
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:54,652
put on her hat, and gathered all seven chicks around her.

267
00:17:54,652 --> 00:17:59,652
Dear children, said the mother, I have to go shopping, and you should stay in
the house.

268
00:17:59,652 --> 00:18:04,152
Please never open the door when it knocks. It could be the wolf.

269
00:18:04,152 --> 00:18:09,052
The children promised it was high and holy, and as soon as the mother was gone,

270
00:18:09,052 --> 00:18:10,852
it knocked on the door.

271
00:18:10,852 --> 00:18:15,252
I am your mother. Open up, dear children. I have brought you nice presents.

272
00:18:15,252 --> 00:18:19,052
I have great longing for you.

273
00:18:20,052 --> 00:18:22,052
I love you.

274
00:18:22,674 --> 00:18:26,674
But of course the clever chicks knew that it was the wolf who stood in front of
their door.

275
00:18:26,674 --> 00:18:29,674
They recognized him by his deep voice.

276
00:18:32,674 --> 00:18:36,674
But the wolf was not stupid either. He knew of course why the chicks recognized
him.

277
00:18:36,674 --> 00:18:40,674
And he slipped away and ate a whole sack of chalk.

278
00:18:43,674 --> 00:18:45,394
Open the door!

279
00:18:45,394 --> 00:18:48,394
Come on, little girl, it's your mother, I'm back!

280
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:52,394
Oh, that's the mother's voice, that's exactly how she speaks.

281
00:18:52,394 --> 00:18:55,394
Show your paws first, they have to be white.

282
00:18:56,394 --> 00:19:01,394
But the wolf was very smart, he had dipped his paws in flour and he showed them.

283
00:19:03,394 --> 00:19:05,394
Hurray, the mother is at home, come in, mother!

284
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,394
But what happened then?

285
00:19:07,394 --> 00:19:09,394
There was the wolf!

286
00:19:10,104 --> 00:19:17,104
He caught the chick and ate it one after the other.

287
00:19:21,104 --> 00:19:24,104
The wolf had such a big belly that he could hardly get out of the house.

288
00:19:24,104 --> 00:19:27,104
He slipped out on all fours.

289
00:19:36,882 --> 00:19:44,882
After a while, the goat mother came home. She was already looking forward to her
children, but when she called, none of them was there and she understood what
had happened.

290
00:19:48,882 --> 00:19:53,882
She ran out of the house again and called each of her children by name, every
single one, but none of them answered.

291
00:19:54,882 --> 00:19:59,882
I told you to be careful, children, little children!

292
00:20:01,176 --> 00:20:06,176
And when the mother called her youngest child, suddenly a quiet voice came out
of the clock.

293
00:20:06,176 --> 00:20:10,176
The youngest was the only one who could save himself from the wolf.

294
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:15,176
The mother told him what had happened and cried big, round tears.

295
00:20:20,176 --> 00:20:24,176
The mother listened to the story and cried along.

296
00:20:25,176 --> 00:20:30,176
The youngest chick was ungrateful and snored loudly.

297
00:20:31,176 --> 00:20:31,256
The mother cried and cried again.

298
00:20:31,256 --> 00:20:39,256
The mother tried to calm the little one and went with him out of the house. She
went around the whole house and through the garden and then out onto the field.

299
00:20:39,256 --> 00:20:50,256
And there on the field, there lay under a big tree the evil wolf and slept. A
terrible fairy tale.

300
00:20:57,778 --> 00:21:00,778
How did it go on? Tell me!

301
00:21:05,778 --> 00:21:07,778
Did he have a big belly?

302
00:21:07,778 --> 00:21:09,778
Of course! And what a...

303
00:21:09,778 --> 00:21:11,778
And he was rumbling and mumbling.

304
00:21:11,778 --> 00:21:14,778
When it was rumbling and mumbling, the mother goat thought,

305
00:21:14,778 --> 00:21:16,778
then they are still alive!

306
00:21:16,778 --> 00:21:19,778
And she ran home quickly and got a big pair of scissors.

307
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,778
And cut the wolf's belly open, from top to bottom.

308
00:21:22,778 --> 00:21:23,228
Cut!

309
00:21:23,228 --> 00:21:30,228
Snip-snap! Snip-snap! And all the chicks jumped out, one after the other. They
jumped and jumped and were happy.

310
00:21:40,726 --> 00:21:43,726
What do you think they were all happy about?

311
00:21:44,726 --> 00:21:46,726
And the wolf was broken.

312
00:21:46,726 --> 00:21:49,726
Poor, poor wolf.

313
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:01,650
But it's not true. A goat can only have one or two boys, and yours has seven.

314
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:04,750
But it's just a story. It doesn't matter if it's not true.

315
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:08,850
It's not true anyway, the way I told the story. I forgot the conclusion.

316
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:10,650
Really?

317
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:15,150
Something's going on with the wolf, but I just don't know what.

318
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,750
I think they put cobblestones in his belly.

319
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,350
I like that.

320
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,750
Come on, let's go to my room.

321
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,950
Clara!

322
00:22:29,366 --> 00:22:31,366
Did you mean it seriously with the pictures earlier?

323
00:22:31,366 --> 00:22:33,366
Of course. So you did listen.

324
00:22:41,366 --> 00:22:43,366
Wait.

325
00:22:51,062 --> 00:22:55,062
And then it was finally time, the carriage was about to pass.

326
00:22:55,062 --> 00:23:01,062
Mr. Sesemann had come home. He stormed the stairs and greeted his daughter Clara
with overwhelming joy.

327
00:23:01,062 --> 00:23:06,062
And also Heidi, who did not dare to say anything out of fear, greeted him with
friendly words.

328
00:23:06,062 --> 00:23:09,062
He spoke to her like to a little lady.

329
00:23:09,062 --> 00:23:12,062
And then he took a package out of his big suitcase.

330
00:23:12,062 --> 00:23:14,062
And that was for Heidi.

331
00:23:14,062 --> 00:23:18,062
Heidi knew from the first moment that she could love Mr. Sesemann very much.

332
00:23:18,062 --> 00:23:20,652
And she wanted to do everything for him.

333
00:23:20,652 --> 00:23:26,892
Mr. Sesemann also liked Heidi from the first moment and he asked Clara and Mrs.
Rottenmeier exactly after the girl.

334
00:23:26,892 --> 00:23:29,612
But we want to tell you about that in our next story.
