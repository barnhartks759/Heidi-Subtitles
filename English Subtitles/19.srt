Find your happiness

15
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,430
Come back home

16
00:01:21,754 --> 00:01:28,754
On a beautiful spring day, Aunt Dete had climbed the Alps and had taken Heidi
with her

17
00:01:28,754 --> 00:01:39,754
She wanted to take Heidi to Frankfurt, where she was to be taken in the house of
the wealthy merchant Sesemann as a playmate for the crippled daughter Clara

18
00:01:39,754 --> 00:01:48,754
Heidi didn't know anything about the plan. She thought Frankfurt would be
somewhere nearby and she would be back on time for dinner

19
00:01:50,448 --> 00:01:55,448
- That's the Frankfurt. - Wait here. I have to go shopping.

20
00:02:19,994 --> 00:02:21,994
Oh, yes.

21
00:02:22,994 --> 00:02:24,994
Do you have white rolls?

22
00:02:24,994 --> 00:02:25,994
That's for you to eat.

23
00:02:25,994 --> 00:02:26,994
Thank you.

24
00:02:26,994 --> 00:02:28,994
And where are the rolls?

25
00:02:28,994 --> 00:02:29,994
You can't get rolls here.

26
00:02:29,994 --> 00:02:31,994
But you said so.

27
00:02:31,994 --> 00:02:32,994
Well, come on.

28
00:02:32,994 --> 00:02:33,994
No, I want to go home.

29
00:02:33,994 --> 00:02:36,994
Grandfather said I should always be at home before it gets dark.

30
00:02:36,994 --> 00:02:38,994
And it's going to be dark soon.

31
00:02:38,994 --> 00:02:40,994
And I tell you, you're not coming.

33
00:02:56,474 --> 00:02:59,474
When are we in Frankfurt? It can't be any further.

34
00:02:59,474 --> 00:03:01,474
My feet hurt so much.

35
00:03:01,474 --> 00:03:03,474
Not for long. Now we're in Mayenfeld.

36
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,474
We're in Mayenfeld?

37
00:03:05,474 --> 00:03:06,474
Yes.

38
00:03:08,474 --> 00:03:10,474
You lied to me!

39
00:03:11,474 --> 00:03:13,361
You said earlier I could...

40
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:15,361
I want to be back this evening!

41
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,361
Oh, did I really say that?

42
00:03:17,361 --> 00:03:19,361
Yes, you did!

43
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:21,361
Then I just said it.

44
00:03:21,361 --> 00:03:24,361
I must have been mistaken, Heidi. Now don't stand there forever.

45
00:03:24,361 --> 00:03:27,361
But I also said that Frankfurt is a beautiful city that you like.

46
00:03:27,361 --> 00:03:29,361
And that wasn't a lie.

47
00:03:29,361 --> 00:03:31,361
I want to go home again!

48
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:33,361
Heidi! No, don't stand there!

49
00:03:33,361 --> 00:03:35,361
I'm slowly running out of patience.

50
00:03:35,361 --> 00:03:38,361
We'll take a train and drive to Frankfurt.

51
00:03:38,361 --> 00:03:40,361
No, I don't want to!

52
00:03:43,361 --> 00:03:45,361
I'm going to the hospital!

53
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:47,361
No, don't stand there!

54
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:49,361
I don't want to!

55
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:51,361
No, don't stand there!

56
00:03:51,361 --> 00:03:53,361
I don't want to!

57
00:03:53,361 --> 00:03:55,361
No, don't stand there!

58
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:56,049
No, don't stand there!

59
00:03:56,049 --> 00:04:00,049
This is our train, Heidi. We have to hurry. Come on!

60
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:02,049
No, I'm not going with you in the train.

61
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:04,049
Oh, come on!

62
00:04:04,093 --> 00:04:06,093
I'm not going! I'm not going!

63
00:04:08,093 --> 00:04:10,093
Don't be like that! Stop screaming!

64
00:04:11,093 --> 00:04:13,093
Stop it!

65
00:04:16,093 --> 00:04:18,093
Go away!

66
00:04:34,093 --> 00:04:37,093
Let me go! Grandfather is waiting! I want to go home!

67
00:04:38,093 --> 00:04:39,057
What are these people doing?

68
00:04:39,057 --> 00:04:41,057
We're finally taking you!

69
00:04:41,057 --> 00:04:42,173
I really wanted that!

70
00:04:42,173 --> 00:04:44,673
I don't care! Let me go! I want to go home!

71
00:04:44,673 --> 00:04:46,173
Heidi!

72
00:05:12,173 --> 00:05:14,173
I don't care! I want to go home!

73
00:05:42,173 --> 00:05:44,173
I don't care! I want to go home!

74
00:06:12,173 --> 00:06:14,173
I really wanted that! I want to go home!

75
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:16,173
I don't care! I want to go home!

76
00:06:16,173 --> 00:06:18,173
I want to go home!

77
00:06:18,173 --> 00:06:20,173
I do love you!

78
00:06:29,753 --> 00:06:30,312
me too!

79
00:06:30,312 --> 00:06:34,312
Heidi, I can imagine very well that you are sad now.

80
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:39,312
I can explain to you why I did that and maybe you'll understand me then.

81
00:06:39,312 --> 00:06:41,312
I want you to be happy once.

82
00:06:41,312 --> 00:06:43,312
Heidi.

83
00:06:45,312 --> 00:06:48,312
I packed a cheese bread for you.

84
00:06:48,312 --> 00:06:51,312
You must be hungry. Please take it, yes?

85
00:06:51,312 --> 00:06:54,312
Heidi, you have to eat. The train ride is long.

86
00:06:55,272 --> 00:07:00,272
And if I stay in Frankfurt for a few days and I don't like it, can I go back?

87
00:07:00,272 --> 00:07:02,272
If you really don't like it.

88
00:07:02,272 --> 00:07:07,272
At least you didn't lie when you said there were white rolls for the
grandmother.

89
00:07:07,272 --> 00:07:11,272
Where I'm going to take you, there are white rolls for breakfast every morning.

90
00:07:13,272 --> 00:07:17,272
Don't you want to bite into the cheese bread now?

91
00:07:20,272 --> 00:07:21,272
No.

92
00:07:25,272 --> 00:07:28,272
* Music *

93
00:07:30,504 --> 00:07:35,504
Maybe it's not as bad in Frankfurt as you think. Maybe you do like it here.

94
00:07:35,504 --> 00:07:39,504
You will have your own room and be able to learn with Clara every day.

95
00:07:39,504 --> 00:07:43,504
- Learn to read? - Yes, and to calculate and write and much more.

96
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:47,504
You have your own teacher and he will teach you everything you need to know.

97
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,468
THE END

* Music *

99
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:14,783
I know what you're thinking, but your Heidi isn't in the village.

100
00:09:15,979 --> 00:09:17,979
Uh-uh.

101
00:09:45,979 --> 00:09:47,979
* Music *

102
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:05,679
I don't know, Brigitte, if we ever see each other again. Maybe she'll never come
back.

103
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:09,679
I wish I could tell you, Grandmother.

104
00:10:40,059 --> 00:10:42,059
To be continued

105
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:47,543
Have you seen what kind of a face he makes?

106
00:10:47,543 --> 00:10:50,543
Strange, I don't know. He's suddenly sorry for me.

107
00:10:50,543 --> 00:10:54,543
I can't help myself either. Hopefully we didn't do him wrong.

108
00:10:54,543 --> 00:10:56,543
No, he has his own fault.

109
00:10:56,543 --> 00:11:00,543
Why is he running up there alone and doesn't let her go to school, huh?

110
00:11:00,543 --> 00:11:03,543
Yes, you have to see that from this side.

111
00:11:03,543 --> 00:11:04,543
Still.

112
00:11:04,543 --> 00:11:06,543
I don't like his face at all.

113
00:11:06,543 --> 00:11:09,543
He must have been very attached to the child.

114
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:13,667
* Music *

115
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,667
* Music *

116
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:13,667
* Music *

117
00:12:13,846 --> 00:12:17,846
But my little one, how can you get so excited, it's already good.

118
00:12:17,846 --> 00:12:19,846
My dear little one.

119
00:12:22,846 --> 00:12:23,846
There she is.

120
00:12:23,846 --> 00:12:24,846
Well?

121
00:12:24,846 --> 00:12:26,846
But I was...

122
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:29,714
I was...

123
00:12:57,714 --> 00:13:11,714
Frankfurt, station number one!

124
00:13:20,714 --> 00:13:22,714
Here we are.

125
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:44,278
Why do you stand there? You're a little surprised about Frankfurt, aren't you?

126
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:46,278
Come on.

127
00:13:51,638 --> 00:13:57,638
So now Heidi was in Frankfurt, in the city where she was supposed to live
against her will now.

128
00:13:57,638 --> 00:14:01,638
Aunt Dede was right. Heidi was really surprised.

129
00:14:01,638 --> 00:14:08,638
Never in her life would she have believed that there would be so many big and
quiet houses in a single city.

130
00:14:08,638 --> 00:14:14,638
Heidi walked through the streets with an open mouth and open eyes and looked at
everything.

131
00:14:14,638 --> 00:14:19,638
And again and again she asked herself: Do I like it now or do I not like it?

132
00:14:19,772 --> 00:14:23,772
Do I want to stay here now or do I want to go back home right away?

133
00:14:26,272 --> 00:14:33,772
But even before she arrived at the house of the Sesemann family with Aunt Dete,
Heidi knew that she wanted to go back.

134
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:38,272
Right in the morning she wanted to get on the train and drive home.

135
00:14:38,272 --> 00:14:45,772
While Heidi was walking through the streets of Frankfurt, Clara Sesemann was
impatiently waiting for the arrival of the little girl,

136
00:14:45,772 --> 00:14:48,772
that she should spend the time in the future.

137
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:52,940
Clara was the only daughter of the merchant Sesemann.

138
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:57,940
She was very sick and had to sit in the wheelchair all day.

139
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:02,940
It takes too long. Time doesn't want to pass. Maybe the clock has stopped.

140
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:07,940
They should have been here long ago. I don't understand.

141
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,940
Clara, Clara, you're slowly coming to me like a broken game clock.

142
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:16,940
You say the same thing all the time. Don't you notice anything new?

143
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,940
No.

144
00:15:41,293 --> 00:15:46,293
I don't want to be impulsive, but can I disturb Miss Rottenmeier so late?

145
00:15:46,293 --> 00:15:48,293
I have no idea.

146
00:15:48,293 --> 00:15:51,293
I had promised Miss Rottenmeier to come by with the child.

147
00:15:51,293 --> 00:15:54,293
Do you know if she's at home this afternoon?

148
00:15:54,293 --> 00:15:59,293
Then ring Sebastian. He must be there. He knows exactly what to do.

149
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:02,293
Yes, if you think so. Thank you.

151
00:16:11,661 --> 00:16:14,661
Heidi, come on, what is it?

152
00:16:15,661 --> 00:16:17,661
Are you afraid?

153
00:16:18,661 --> 00:16:20,661
You can't get out of the traffic jam anymore.

154
00:16:20,661 --> 00:16:24,661
The Sesemann family is one of the richest families here in Frankfurt.

155
00:16:24,661 --> 00:16:27,661
You will definitely like it. They are very nice.

156
00:16:27,661 --> 00:16:29,661
May I stay here?

157
00:16:32,661 --> 00:16:34,661
What can I do for you?

158
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:38,661
I would like to speak to Miss Rottenmeier. Do you know if she is at home?

159
00:16:38,661 --> 00:16:40,661
Hmm...

160
00:16:41,613 --> 00:16:44,613
That is difficult to answer.

161
00:16:44,613 --> 00:16:45,613
Why?

162
00:16:45,613 --> 00:16:50,613
Unfortunately, you have to ring one more time and ask Ms. Lanquinette.

163
00:17:00,429 --> 00:17:03,429
Yes, please. What do you want, madame?

164
00:17:03,429 --> 00:17:05,429
I would like to speak to Miss Rottenmeier.

165
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:08,429
My name is Dete. I have an appointment with Miss Rottenmeier.

166
00:17:08,429 --> 00:17:11,429
If you would please tell her that I am here.

167
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:13,429
Very well.

168
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:19,301
Let's go back home

169
00:17:19,301 --> 00:17:23,301
Don't talk stupid stuff, we can't go back, understand that at last

170
00:17:25,301 --> 00:17:27,301
They are waiting

171
00:17:27,301 --> 00:17:29,301
Oh thank you, that's very friendly of you

172
00:17:29,301 --> 00:17:32,301
Go Heidi and behave yourself

173
00:17:34,301 --> 00:17:37,301
Be always nice and polite and if someone asks you, you answer

174
00:17:37,301 --> 00:17:41,301
And if you say good day, you make a nod and don't poke your nose

175
00:17:46,301 --> 00:17:48,301
Thank you

176
00:18:08,516 --> 00:18:10,516
Miss Dette is here.

177
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:25,180
So, there we are.

178
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,180
Yes.

179
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,180
This is Heidi, my niece.

180
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,180
Good day.

181
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,180
I told you about her.

182
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,180
We just arrived.

183
00:18:39,748 --> 00:18:41,748
Aha!

184
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:54,708
- Where are you going? - Don't stand around like a nag. Say something.

185
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:58,708
- You shut up. There's only one person talking here. - Yes, of course. Excuse
me.

186
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:03,708
- If you happen to be able to speak, can you tell me your name? - Heidi.

187
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:07,708
- Erbarmung! What a name! That's not your real name.

188
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,708
What name did you get married to?

189
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:14,708
And if the bride is not too comfortable, then maybe she has the kindness to
share this name with you.

190
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:17,708
- I already told him. - How dare you!

191
00:19:17,914 --> 00:19:19,914
Why are you talking to me like that?

192
00:19:19,914 --> 00:19:21,914
Isn't the child smart in the head?

193
00:19:21,914 --> 00:19:23,914
Or is it just rude, cheeky and loud?

194
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:25,914
She's just a little scared at the moment.

195
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,914
Maybe I can answer for her.

196
00:19:27,914 --> 00:19:29,914
She's not used to such an environment.

197
00:19:31,914 --> 00:19:33,914
She's neither cheeky nor rude.

198
00:19:33,914 --> 00:19:35,914
She just always says exactly what she thinks.

199
00:19:35,914 --> 00:19:37,914
Heidi has never lied, as far as I know.

200
00:19:39,914 --> 00:19:41,914
Why are you touching me?

201
00:19:44,772 --> 00:19:52,772
But of course Heidi also has a baptismal name, her name is Adelheid, she was
named after her mother, after my deceased sister Adelheid.

202
00:19:52,772 --> 00:19:57,772
But we never called her that, that's why she doesn't know it. Heidi is shorter
and calls herself better.

203
00:19:57,772 --> 00:20:00,772
Aha, I understand. A very good name.

204
00:20:00,772 --> 00:20:01,772
Yes.

205
00:20:01,772 --> 00:20:05,772
I can't help it, but didn't you misunderstand me, lady?

206
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:06,772
Misunderstood?

207
00:20:06,922 --> 00:20:11,422
Yes, I was looking for a playmate in Clara's age. She's never twelve.

208
00:20:11,422 --> 00:20:16,722
I said explicitly that I was looking for someone who could study with Clara.

209
00:20:16,722 --> 00:20:18,722
Who is spiritually mature.

210
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:26,450
But that's for sure. Heidi understands very quickly. She's an eloquent, smart
child and very lively. I know, she's a little small, but that disappoints.

211
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,450
I don't know exactly. I think she's a little over ten or...

212
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:32,450
But I know. Grandfather said I'm eight years old.

213
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:35,450
Calm down. The child is only eight years old? How terrible.

214
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:37,450
Don't always say such stupid things.

215
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:39,450
Is it bad if you're eight?

216
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:45,210
Dede, she's four years younger than Clara. What should the two of them start
with each other?

217
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:48,210
But Heidi is especially clever for her age, really.

218
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:51,210
And which book have we used for our reading studies?

219
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:53,210
I've never had a book.

220
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,210
I think I'm going to get hit right now.

221
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:58,210
Did you mean to say that you can't read at all and can't write?

222
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:01,210
Peter can't read either, and he even went to school once.

223
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:04,210
You haven't even gone to school, you liar, my child.

224
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:07,210
Or are you saying the truth after all?

225
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,210
And something like that in our house?

226
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:12,929
Oh world, what's going to happen to you with so many uneducated people?

227
00:21:12,929 --> 00:21:15,929
Have you ever learned anything in your life?

228
00:21:15,929 --> 00:21:17,929
Well, you ask questions.

229
00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:22,929
I can whistle on my fingers and watch out for the goats and even milk.

230
00:21:22,929 --> 00:21:23,929
Calm down!

231
00:21:25,929 --> 00:21:31,929
No wonder I have a headache. I'm just wondering why you brought this child here,
Dete.

232
00:21:31,929 --> 00:21:35,929
Because Heidi is exactly like the girl you were looking for for Clara.

233
00:21:35,929 --> 00:21:37,929
At least that's what they described her to me.

234
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:38,929
Never!

235
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:42,841
Oh yes, that's what they have. They were looking for a girl with a good
character.

236
00:21:42,841 --> 00:21:47,341
She should be well raised, not lie, understand quickly and waste Clara's time.

237
00:21:47,341 --> 00:21:49,741
And this description fits exactly with Heidi.

238
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:54,141
First of all, they should take better care of her. Then they'll see that I'm
right.

239
00:21:57,741 --> 00:22:01,241
I'm sorry, I have to go. My master is waiting for me.

240
00:22:01,241 --> 00:22:04,341
I'll come by in the next few days and see how she's doing.

241
00:22:04,341 --> 00:22:07,641
Stop going and just leave the child here!

242
00:22:07,641 --> 00:22:08,641
Get out of here!

243
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:10,785
Get out of here!

244
00:22:21,243 --> 00:22:32,243
Aunt Dete had left her alone in this strange big house with these strange girls
and with Miss Rottenmeier, who always said condolences.

245
00:22:32,243 --> 00:22:36,243
Clara was very nice, but the others, how were they?

246
00:22:36,243 --> 00:22:41,243
Heidi felt very, very lonely for the first time in her life.

247
00:22:41,243 --> 00:22:48,243
There were so many people here in this big city, but she knew nobody except Aunt
Dete.

248
00:22:49,979 --> 00:22:55,979
Frankfurt. How was Heidi supposed to see the mountains from here that she loved
so much?

249
00:22:55,979 --> 00:22:59,979
The house, the big crown lights, all of that scared us.

250
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:05,979
The many forks and knives on the table, the white tablecloth, the admonitions
and explanations of Miss Rottenmeier.

251
00:23:05,979 --> 00:23:08,979
Everything was unusual and new for Heidi.

252
00:23:08,979 --> 00:23:14,979
There was Tinette, the maid, who always complained to Clara about the servant
Sebastian.

253
00:23:14,979 --> 00:23:16,979
And of course there was Clara.

254
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:20,905
Whether Clara could ever become such a good friend as Peter?

255
00:23:21,505 --> 00:23:23,905
Heidi thought about it and made a decision.

256
00:23:24,505 --> 00:23:28,105
But we want to tell you about it in our next story.

257
00:23:28,999 --> 00:23:36,799
Heidi, Heidi, your world are the mountains.

258
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:44,799
Heidi, Heidi, because up here you are at home.

259
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:57,799
Heidi, Heidi, come home, find your happiness, come back home.

260
00:23:58,999 --> 00:24:00,440
