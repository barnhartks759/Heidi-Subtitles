00:00:05,058 --> 00:00:10,058

3
00:00:10,058 --> 00:00:15,058
Thank you very much for your support.

4
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:20,058
Thank you very much for your support.

5
00:00:20,058 --> 00:00:25,058
Thank you very much for your support.

6
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:25,466
Thank you very much for your support.

7
00:00:25,466 --> 00:00:28,466
The mountains are the world

8
00:00:28,466 --> 00:00:32,466
Heidi, Heidi

9
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:36,466
Because up here you are at home

10
00:00:36,466 --> 00:00:40,466
Dark fir trees

11
00:00:40,466 --> 00:00:44,466
Green meadows in the sunshine

12
00:00:44,466 --> 00:00:48,466
Heidi, Heidi

13
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:50,426
Do you need to be...

14
00:00:50,426 --> 00:00:52,426
to be happy

15
00:00:52,966 --> 00:01:01,206
Heide, heide, heide, heide, heide, heide...

16
00:01:01,206 --> 00:01:05,786
Holla lala lilla lilla lilla holla lilla ho

17
00:01:05,786 --> 00:01:11,786
Heide, Heide, come home

18
00:01:11,786 --> 00:01:18,566
Find your happiness, and come back home

19
00:01:53,966 --> 00:01:54,966
Is it blowing?

20
00:01:54,966 --> 00:01:56,966
Of course! It's a thunderstorm!

21
00:02:22,966 --> 00:02:38,966
Heidi, hurry up! Come on, quick!

22
00:02:38,966 --> 00:02:42,966
I like it!

23
00:02:42,966 --> 00:02:44,966
It's a bit rainy.

24
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:49,966
Whoever goes first, wins!

25
00:02:52,966 --> 00:02:54,966
I like it!

26
00:03:02,834 --> 00:03:04,834
Snuggie.

27
00:03:06,834 --> 00:03:09,834
Mama is alone up there. She must be scared.

28
00:03:24,402 --> 00:03:28,402
That's terrible. Maumau must be scared too.

29
00:03:41,402 --> 00:03:42,386
Shit!

30
00:03:42,386 --> 00:03:44,386
Mou Mou Mou, I'm Heidi.

31
00:03:49,386 --> 00:03:51,314
Are you scared?

32
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,314
Now it's all good. Now I'm with you.

33
00:03:54,314 --> 00:03:56,314
La, la, la.

34
00:03:56,314 --> 00:03:59,314
Poor little kitty.

35
00:04:03,634 --> 00:04:05,634
Is there someone?

36
00:04:05,634 --> 00:04:07,634
It's me, Heidi.

37
00:04:07,634 --> 00:04:09,634
Come in, there's no one here.

38
00:04:11,634 --> 00:04:13,634
Meow, meow!

39
00:04:16,946 --> 00:04:22,946
Well, you? Were you afraid of the thunderstorm, all alone up there in the tower?

40
00:04:22,946 --> 00:04:24,946
I think we both thought the same thing.

41
00:04:24,946 --> 00:04:27,946
I'd rather keep her in bed with me tonight.

42
00:04:27,946 --> 00:04:30,946
I wish I could keep her with me too.

43
00:04:30,946 --> 00:04:34,946
Well, then let her sleep with you if you want.

44
00:04:34,946 --> 00:04:36,946
Can I keep her?

45
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:40,458
No, no, you'd better take her. She's used to you.

46
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,458
She doesn't know me as well as you do.

47
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,458
You'd rather have Mr. Rottenmeier come in.

48
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:47,458
Exactly. And imagine, the cat is in my bed when she comes.

49
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:51,458
Good night, Mau Mau. Now you don't have to be afraid anymore.

50
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,458
I already know that. Sleep well.

51
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:56,458
Good night. Sleep well. See you tomorrow for breakfast.

52
00:04:57,458 --> 00:05:00,458
So, Mau Mau, we're here. This is my room.

53
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:03,458
How do you like the bed? Is it soft enough?

54
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:08,242
To be continued...

55
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:11,242
So you like it just as much as your bed.

56
00:05:16,242 --> 00:05:18,242
Don't be afraid, Momo. I'm with you.

57
00:05:18,242 --> 00:05:21,242
Now the thunderstorm can't do anything to you.

58
00:05:21,242 --> 00:05:25,242
Do you want to lie down? How else are we supposed to sleep?

59
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,242
You know it's tickling, right?

60
00:06:33,066 --> 00:06:35,066
Good morning, Mom.

61
00:06:36,066 --> 00:06:39,066
Adelheid, where's Janine? It's time for breakfast.

62
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,270
FrÃ¤ulein Rottenmeier. Oh dear, what now?

63
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,270
Adelheid, what is it? Answer me!

64
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,270
I'll be right there. I just have to get dressed quickly.

65
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:51,270
You're still not dressed. You know, breakfast starts at 8.05 a.m.

66
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,270
Yes, I know. I'm in a hurry.

67
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:56,270
You'll bring me to my senses at some point.

68
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:00,270
You took quite a long time to get out of bed, Adelheid.

69
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,270
What?

70
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,270
Now I thought you were at least dressed.

71
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,270
I'm sorry.

72
00:07:06,528 --> 00:07:08,128
Sorry, sorry.

73
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:11,288
All day long, I hear nothing but sorry.

74
00:07:11,288 --> 00:07:15,128
Act like a good kid, then it wouldn't be necessary.

75
00:07:15,128 --> 00:07:19,328
I'm in the call to be a good teacher, but with you...

76
00:07:19,328 --> 00:07:20,988
What's with the fax?

77
00:07:20,988 --> 00:07:22,628
Do you think that's a good thing?

78
00:07:22,628 --> 00:07:24,628
You'd better brush your teeth and then come.

79
00:07:29,354 --> 00:07:31,354
That was good.

80
00:07:39,354 --> 00:07:41,354
Come back quickly!

81
00:07:43,018 --> 00:07:46,018
They're all waiting for you at the table. Hurry up!

82
00:07:46,018 --> 00:07:48,018
Just one minute, then I'll be there.

83
00:07:48,018 --> 00:07:52,018
There will be spiegeleier this morning. They're already on the plate and will
get cold very quickly.

84
00:07:54,018 --> 00:07:57,018
Psst, Mau Mau, you have to be very quiet. You're not allowed to whine.

85
00:07:57,018 --> 00:08:01,018
Psst, be quiet. I'll be right back.

86
00:08:08,202 --> 00:08:12,202
We have Sunday, Mrs. Clara. The class is over.

87
00:08:12,202 --> 00:08:16,202
You should use the time and rest in bed.

88
00:08:16,202 --> 00:08:19,202
For you, Adelheid, that doesn't mean anything.

89
00:08:19,202 --> 00:08:21,202
You should take care of your alphabet.

90
00:08:21,202 --> 00:08:26,202
We want you to be able to follow the class as soon as possible,

91
00:08:26,202 --> 00:08:29,202
and not always lag behind. You want that too, don't you?

92
00:08:29,202 --> 00:08:33,202
I hope that my orders will be followed, even if I'm not there.

93
00:08:33,202 --> 00:08:36,202
I have to leave today, unfortunately. I'm invited.

94
00:08:36,202 --> 00:08:39,202
That doesn't matter, Mrs. Rottenmeier.

95
00:08:40,874 --> 00:08:43,874
Please, Miss Clara, don't be like that.

96
00:08:43,874 --> 00:08:45,874
Make sure you have a good night's sleep.

97
00:08:45,874 --> 00:08:46,874
It's good for you.

98
00:08:46,874 --> 00:08:47,874
Yes, I will.

99
00:08:47,874 --> 00:08:49,874
And since I have to meet for preparations,

100
00:08:49,874 --> 00:08:50,874
I have to say goodbye to you.

101
00:08:50,874 --> 00:08:51,874
Goodbye.

102
00:08:52,874 --> 00:08:53,874
Juliette!

103
00:08:53,874 --> 00:08:54,874
Juliette!

104
00:08:57,874 --> 00:08:59,874
Did you give Mama breakfast today?

105
00:08:59,874 --> 00:09:01,874
No, I overslept today.

106
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:02,874
She's still in my room.

107
00:09:02,874 --> 00:09:05,874
And Miss Rottenmeier didn't see her this morning?

108
00:09:05,874 --> 00:09:07,874
No, I quickly hid her in the cupboard upstairs.

109
00:09:10,056 --> 00:09:11,056
Thank God!

110
00:09:11,056 --> 00:09:13,556
It's better if I get her right away and bring her to the tower.

111
00:09:13,556 --> 00:09:16,056
Careful, Mrs. Rottenmeier isn't gone yet.

112
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,056
You'd better not go past her room.

113
00:09:18,056 --> 00:09:20,056
I would wait at your place until she leaves the house.

114
00:09:20,056 --> 00:09:21,056
That's safer.

115
00:09:21,056 --> 00:09:22,556
You're right, Sebastian.

116
00:09:22,556 --> 00:09:24,556
You know what? I've never seen an animal eat.

117
00:09:24,556 --> 00:09:26,556
I'd like to know how Mau Mau does it.

118
00:09:26,556 --> 00:09:28,556
Bring her in here afterwards and feed her here.

119
00:09:28,556 --> 00:09:30,056
Then I can watch her.

120
00:09:30,056 --> 00:09:32,056
I think it's incredibly cute when she slaps.

121
00:09:32,056 --> 00:09:34,056
Yes! Hooray! It's going to be done!

122
00:09:34,056 --> 00:09:35,056
Shh!

123
00:09:35,056 --> 00:09:36,556
I hear something.

124
00:09:40,056 --> 00:09:42,056
To be continued...

125
00:09:42,466 --> 00:09:45,466
Take care of the house and the children, Sebastian.

126
00:09:45,466 --> 00:09:47,466
Very well, madam.

127
00:09:57,954 --> 00:09:59,954
She's gone.

128
00:09:59,954 --> 00:10:01,954
Good, then I'll give her something to eat. She must be hungry.

129
00:10:01,954 --> 00:10:05,954
Are you hungry, Mau Mau? Poor little Mau Mau, you waited so long.

130
00:10:05,954 --> 00:10:07,954
Why is this door always open?

131
00:10:07,954 --> 00:10:09,954
Be careful.

132
00:10:09,954 --> 00:10:11,954
You can eat that already.

133
00:10:11,954 --> 00:10:14,954
But that was really sweet, Sebastian.

134
00:10:14,954 --> 00:10:16,954
But I liked doing that.

135
00:10:16,954 --> 00:10:19,954
Don't eat here, Mau Mau. Over there with Clara, come.

136
00:10:19,954 --> 00:10:21,954
Here, Mau Mau, eat nicely.

137
00:10:24,954 --> 00:10:26,954
It tastes good. She's eating.

138
00:10:27,954 --> 00:10:30,954
Good girl, my dear cat.

139
00:10:50,306 --> 00:10:55,306
She washes and cleans herself the whole day. I think she's a particularly clean
cat.

140
00:10:55,306 --> 00:10:56,306
You think so?

141
00:10:56,306 --> 00:10:57,306
I'm sure everyone does that.

142
00:11:04,738 --> 00:11:07,738
Mama, you've fallen over.

143
00:11:10,738 --> 00:11:13,738
Today we can at least have a nap again.

144
00:11:13,738 --> 00:11:17,738
I feel like I was born again when the old woman left the house three days ago.

145
00:11:21,738 --> 00:11:23,738
Who could that be?

146
00:11:25,738 --> 00:11:27,738
Miss Rottenmeier, you're back already?

147
00:11:27,738 --> 00:11:29,738
Yes, I forgot something.

148
00:11:31,928 --> 00:11:34,928
Can I help you? I can get it for you.

149
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:35,928
Don't bother.

150
00:11:36,928 --> 00:11:39,928
But it doesn't really matter to me. Not at all. That's what I'm here for.

151
00:11:44,962 --> 00:11:46,962
What?

152
00:11:53,826 --> 00:11:55,826
Now it's my turn again.

153
00:11:55,826 --> 00:11:57,826
Give me Heidi again.

154
00:11:57,826 --> 00:11:59,826
Yes, that's good.

155
00:11:59,826 --> 00:12:01,826
She doesn't want to stay on my lap.

156
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:07,826
Then take her away, Heidi.

157
00:12:07,826 --> 00:12:09,826
Hansi must be afraid.

158
00:12:09,826 --> 00:12:11,826
Come on.

159
00:12:13,826 --> 00:12:15,826
No.

160
00:12:15,826 --> 00:12:16,538
Come in.

161
00:12:16,538 --> 00:12:17,938
What is it, Sebastian?

162
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:20,438
Adelheid, what are you hiding there in front of me?

163
00:12:21,838 --> 00:12:25,138
Adelheid, please look at me when I talk to you.

164
00:12:25,138 --> 00:12:28,138
I just asked you what you were hiding in front of me.

165
00:12:28,438 --> 00:12:30,438
I taught her the alphabet.

166
00:12:30,438 --> 00:12:32,138
That's why she's here with me.

167
00:12:32,138 --> 00:12:36,138
You said yourself that she should learn it, didn't you?

168
00:12:36,438 --> 00:12:40,938
Miss Clara, please have mercy and don't dare to lie again.

169
00:12:41,838 --> 00:12:43,438
Oh, a cat!

170

Subtitles by the Amara.org community

171
00:12:47,674 --> 00:12:48,674
What now?

172
00:12:48,674 --> 00:12:49,674
I don't know either.

173
00:12:49,674 --> 00:12:52,674
Tinette! Tinette! A cat again!

174
00:12:52,674 --> 00:12:54,674
Bring the terrible animal here immediately!

175
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:57,674
Oh no! Don't touch her! The cat belongs to me!

176
00:12:57,674 --> 00:13:00,674
I only asked Heidi to watch over her.

177
00:13:00,674 --> 00:13:03,674
Never in life does the cat belong to you, Mrs. Clara!

178
00:13:03,674 --> 00:13:05,674
Oh yes! It belongs to me!

179
00:13:05,674 --> 00:13:08,674
It belongs to me for a long time. Her name is Mau Mau.

180
00:13:08,674 --> 00:13:12,674
So, whatever it is, give the cat to Tinette immediately

181
00:13:12,674 --> 00:13:14,674
and then I want to talk to you, Mrs. Clara.

182
00:13:14,674 --> 00:13:17,392
This is unfortunately impossible for me at the moment.

183
00:13:17,392 --> 00:13:20,392
I don't have time to enter the room. Not as long as the cat is there.

184
00:13:20,392 --> 00:13:22,392
What are you waiting for, Nortonette?

185
00:13:22,392 --> 00:13:24,392
Mrs. Clara!

186
00:13:28,986 --> 00:13:33,986
I can't change it, Heidi. You have to give Mama Tinette, unfortunately.

187
00:13:36,986 --> 00:13:39,986
Please don't hurt her, okay?

188
00:13:44,986 --> 00:13:47,986
Get out of the house with the cat!

189
00:13:56,218 --> 00:14:01,218
Miss Clara, was that the whole truth that the cat belongs to you?

190
00:14:01,218 --> 00:14:04,218
Yes, of course, why not?

191
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:12,218
I'm sorry, but unfortunately I can't allow you to keep the cat for health
reasons.

192
00:14:14,218 --> 00:14:18,218
Cats transmit diseases and we really can't use that.

193
00:14:18,218 --> 00:14:22,800
I don't have to tell you how sensitive they are, how easy they get infected.

194
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,300
Who knows what the cats are up to outside and what they'll bring in with them.

195
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,800
I can't allow you to keep the cat.

196
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,800
Why does it have to be a cat?

197
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,300
Your father bought you all the toys there are.

198
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,800
He even called the child.

199
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,300
But...

200
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,300
No, the cat has to get out of the house.

201
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,300
And now no more rumors.

202
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,082
To be continued...

203
00:14:53,082 --> 00:14:58,082
In the meantime, Dinette has followed my orders and got the cat out of the
house.

204
00:14:59,082 --> 00:15:00,082
Clara!

205
00:15:00,082 --> 00:15:02,082
You stay out of this, okay?

206
00:15:03,082 --> 00:15:04,082
Understood?

207
00:15:05,082 --> 00:15:07,082
Did you understand too, Miss Clara?

208
00:15:23,082 --> 00:15:28,082
Thank you for watching!

209
00:15:28,338 --> 00:15:30,338
Stay here!

210
00:15:30,338 --> 00:15:33,338
What are you doing? Get the cat out of here!

211
00:15:33,338 --> 00:15:35,338
Right away, madam.

212
00:15:35,338 --> 00:15:38,338
Mau Mau! Give her to me! Mau Mau!

213
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:39,338
What an insolent name!

214
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:43,338
How often do I have to tell you to disappear and throw the cat out of the house?

215
00:15:43,338 --> 00:15:44,338
Right away!

216
00:15:44,338 --> 00:15:46,338
Mau Mau!

217
00:15:47,338 --> 00:15:50,338
Clara! Clara! Help me!

218
00:15:58,338 --> 00:16:02,338
No! I want my cat!

219
00:16:02,338 --> 00:16:04,338
You don't want it at all! You stay in there!

220
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:09,714
And I'll get you out of here as soon as you've come to your senses.

221
00:16:35,714 --> 00:16:37,714
To be continued...

222
00:16:37,906 --> 00:16:41,906
Miss Rottenmeier sent me. She wants you to take your medicine, Mrs. Clara.

223
00:16:45,906 --> 00:16:47,906
Is Heidi still in her room?

224
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:50,906
No, she has calmed down. You can't hear anything anymore.

225
00:16:59,794 --> 00:17:03,794
I'm surprised. I didn't think she'd calm down.

226
00:17:03,794 --> 00:17:06,794
I thought she wouldn't calm down anymore.

227
00:17:06,794 --> 00:17:08,794
Me too.

228

229
00:17:45,042 --> 00:17:48,042
Goodbye, Clara. Live well.

232
00:18:39,562 --> 00:18:41,562
What do you pay me when I take you there?

233
00:18:41,562 --> 00:18:43,562
I don't have any money.

234
00:18:43,562 --> 00:18:45,562
Then go to your house.

235
00:18:45,562 --> 00:18:48,562
I'll never go there again. Never.

236
00:18:48,562 --> 00:18:50,562
I want to go home again.

237
00:18:52,562 --> 00:18:55,562
And you want to go with the zoo? I don't think you have any money with you.

238
00:18:55,562 --> 00:18:57,562
Money?

239
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:07,170
Why are you running away from the rich man's house?

240
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:09,170
You must have everything you need.

241
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:12,170
Do you know the kitten? They've chased it away.

242
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:14,170
And now you're running away too.

243
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,170
Oh, I see.

244
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:18,170
Did you like to have her?

245
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,170
Take this with you, I'll give it to you.

246
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:29,170
Don't be afraid, you don't have to pay anything.

247
00:19:29,718 --> 00:19:34,718
Johan! Stop! Johan! Stop it!

248
00:19:34,718 --> 00:19:35,718
What was that?

249
00:19:45,998 --> 00:19:47,038
Johann?

250
00:19:47,418 --> 00:19:48,418
Stop!

251
00:19:49,698 --> 00:19:50,698
Johann!

252
00:19:50,878 --> 00:19:52,138
Stop!

253
00:19:59,138 --> 00:20:00,042
You impossible...

254
00:20:00,042 --> 00:20:03,042
What have you got here on the street to look for?

255
00:20:03,042 --> 00:20:04,042
So come!

256
00:20:04,042 --> 00:20:06,042
No, I don't want to come with you!

257
00:20:06,358 --> 00:20:10,358
I want to go home! My buns! No!

258
00:20:13,358 --> 00:20:17,358
Where are the buns? Now they're all lost!

259
00:20:36,358 --> 00:20:38,358
I want to go home!

260
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:54,630
Mr. Rottenmeier, it's something terrible, it's something unbelievable, it's
something very terrible.

261
00:20:54,630 --> 00:21:00,430
Adelaide, imagine, she was in the middle of the city, that's unbearable for me.
Terrible.

262
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,430
Yes.

263
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:07,430
What could have happened there, she doesn't know her way around the city at all,
at least I'm responsible for her.

264
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,430
Good day, Heidi.

265
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:12,930
Head up, little girl, we've all been very worried.

266
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:16,930
Especially Mrs. Clara, she doesn't want to stop crying at all.

267
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:19,430
I have to tell you something about Maumau.

268
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:23,640
Tinette gave it to me, and I brought it home to my brother.

269
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,640
It's going very well here. My brother also has two children.

270
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,640
They play with her all day. My brother has a garden.

271
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,640
She can run outside.

272
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,640
Heidi, it's going very well here. Believe me.

273
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,640
Yes.

274
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,640
Well, a little calmer. At least we didn't chase her down the street.

275
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,640
We're going to Clara now. She's already waiting.

276
00:21:49,640 --> 00:22:02,640
Heidi, is Heidi back home?

277
00:22:02,722 --> 00:22:06,722
Heidi, oh Heidi, I'm so happy that you're here.

278
00:22:09,222 --> 00:22:14,722
Please never secretly run away again. I was so scared if you had run away now.

279
00:22:16,722 --> 00:22:20,722
Please Heidi, promise me that you'll never run away again, please.

280
00:22:25,026 --> 00:22:28,026
I couldn't do it, even if I wanted to!

281
00:22:30,026 --> 00:22:31,026
But Heidi...

282
00:22:37,538 --> 00:22:40,538
That was not a nice day for the two girls.

283
00:22:40,538 --> 00:22:43,538
But how could they understand Mrs. Rottenmeier,

284
00:22:43,538 --> 00:22:46,538
who imagined herself to understand so much about children

285
00:22:46,538 --> 00:22:48,538
and yet understood so little about them?

286
00:22:48,538 --> 00:22:51,538
Heidi still had the hope not given up to realize her dream.

287
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:54,538
She still firmly believed that one day

288
00:22:54,538 --> 00:22:58,538
Grandmother and Brigitte could bring a whole basket full of white rolls.

289
00:22:58,632 --> 00:23:04,232
Heidi could squeak with pleasure at the idea of how she would survive Mrs.
Rottenmeier one day.

290
00:23:04,232 --> 00:23:11,432
She dreamed of sneaking past Antinette in the middle of the night from the house
and riding home on a big rock.

291
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:17,032
But until this dream could only come true, Heidi still had a lot of difficulties
to experience.

292
00:23:17,032 --> 00:23:21,232
For example, Mrs. Rottenmeier found the white rolls one day.

293
00:23:21,232 --> 00:23:26,030
But we want to tell you about that in our next story.

294
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:34,030
Heidi, Heidi, your world are the mountains.

295
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:42,030
Heidi, Heidi, because up here you are at home.

296
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:48,030
Heidi, Heidi, come home.

297
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:55,030
Find your happiness, come back again.

298
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,632
Thank you for watching.
