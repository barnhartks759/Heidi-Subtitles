1
00:00:02,566 --> 00:00:17,566
Holadio

2
00:00:20,566 --> 00:00:24,566
Heidi

3
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:28,566
Your world are the mountains

4
00:00:28,566 --> 00:00:32,566
Heidi

5
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:36,566
Because up here you are at home

6
00:00:36,566 --> 00:00:40,566
Dark bees

7
00:00:40,566 --> 00:00:44,566
Green meadows in the sunshine

8
00:00:44,566 --> 00:00:48,566
Heidi

9
00:00:48,566 --> 00:00:52,566
You need to be happy

10
00:00:58,566 --> 00:01:05,566
Heidi

11
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:09,566
Heidi

12
00:01:09,566 --> 00:01:11,566
Come home

13
00:01:11,566 --> 00:01:13,566
Find your happiness

14
00:01:13,566 --> 00:01:18,566
Come back home

15
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:28,410
are waking up this morning particularly early. Mr. Sesemann, Clara's father, was
supposed to come home.

16
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:32,550
He had sent a telegram and announced his arrival.

17
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:57,870
The next morning.

18
00:01:57,882 --> 00:01:59,882
Mr. Sesemann is coming!

19
00:02:01,882 --> 00:02:03,882
Hurry up, Mr. Sesemann is coming!

20
00:02:03,882 --> 00:02:05,882
Already? How terrible!

21
00:02:06,882 --> 00:02:07,882
Finally!

22
00:02:08,882 --> 00:02:10,882
Father is coming! You'll see, he's really very nice!

23
00:02:10,882 --> 00:02:13,882
I'm so happy! You don't even believe how happy I am!

24
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,390
Good afternoon, Sebastian.

25
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,390
Welcome home, Mr. Sesemann.

26
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,390
Thank you, Sebastian. We'll talk later.

27
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:30,390
There's a lot to talk about. You've been away for a very long time.

28
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,390
Good afternoon, Tinette.

29
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,890
Good afternoon, Mrs. Rottenmeier.

30
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,390
Welcome home, Mr. Sesemann.

31
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,390
Has my daughter already woken up?

32
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,390
Oh yes, of course, for many hours.

33
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,390
She couldn't wait to see you.

34
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,390
Has the little one from Switzerland woken up too?

35
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,390
When I last saw her, she was there.

36
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,390
Please, Mr. Sesemann, wait a moment.

37
00:02:50,528 --> 00:02:53,528
I'm sorry that I have to bother you with your return.

38
00:02:53,528 --> 00:02:56,528
But you don't know what we've been through here.

39
00:02:56,528 --> 00:02:57,528
This shop...

40
00:02:57,528 --> 00:03:00,528
I want to see Clara first. We'll talk about it later.

41
00:03:00,528 --> 00:03:04,528
Sebastian, please bring the smaller one of the two suitcases upstairs into my
daughter's room.

42
00:03:04,528 --> 00:03:05,528
All right, Mr. Sesemann.

43
00:03:05,528 --> 00:03:07,528
Clara! Clara!

44
00:03:08,528 --> 00:03:10,528
Finally! I'm home again, Clara!

45
00:03:10,528 --> 00:03:13,528
I thought you'd never come back. Finally!

46
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:17,219
But Clara, what's the matter? I always come back.

47
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:19,219
Let me look at you, my child. You're still so pretty.

48
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:20,219
I haven't seen you in three months.

49
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:23,219
I want to introduce you to someone. Listen to me, Father.

50
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:26,219
Yes, you're just as pretty, if not even prettier.

51
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:29,219
Now listen to me. I want to introduce you to someone.

52
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:32,219
My best friend. Father, this is Heidi.

53
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:35,219
So, you're little Heidi.

54
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:37,219
Heidi, this is my father.

55
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:39,219
Well, did I promise you too much?

56
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,219
I'm happy to make your acquaintance, my child.

57
00:03:42,219 --> 00:03:43,515
Good day.

58
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:49,115
Well, how do you get along with my daughter? I know her. I have often felt
enough of her head.

59
00:03:49,115 --> 00:03:54,315
Yes, you both argue a lot. But don't let yourself get caught up. Clara usually
has the last word.

60
00:03:54,315 --> 00:03:59,115
I can imagine how it is. You say the same thing a thousand times and then you
have to start all over again.

61
00:03:59,115 --> 00:04:03,315
But father, what nonsense are you talking about all of a sudden? What should
Heidi think of me?

62
00:04:03,315 --> 00:04:06,315
Don't believe him. We haven't fought each other a single time yet.

63
00:04:06,315 --> 00:04:08,315
That's right, Heidi.

64
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:11,315
What are we supposed to argue about?

65
00:04:12,331 --> 00:04:15,331
You seem to understand each other well. That makes me feel better.

66
00:04:17,031 --> 00:04:21,031
If what you're saying is true, then you seem to have earned a reward.

67
00:04:21,031 --> 00:04:23,031
What is it? Why aren't you coming?

68
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:25,331
Here, Clara.

69
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,831
Oh, thank you, Father. Thank you very much.

70
00:04:27,831 --> 00:04:28,631
Here, Heidi.

71
00:04:28,631 --> 00:04:30,031
Is this really for me?

72
00:04:30,031 --> 00:04:32,331
Of course. Is there another Heidi here?

73
00:04:32,331 --> 00:04:35,331
No, there's only one Heidi here. Thank you, Mr. Sesemann.

74
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:40,531
Isn't she pretty?

75
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:42,539
She is really very pretty.

76
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:46,539
The most beautiful doll in the world.

77
00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:49,539
Heidi liked Mr. Sesemann from the first moment on.

78
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,539
And not just because of the doll.

79
00:04:52,539 --> 00:04:54,539
It's not that simple, unfortunately.

80
00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:56,539
Since this child is here, everything is mixed up.

81
00:04:56,539 --> 00:04:58,539
Everything is on the head. I have lost control.

82
00:04:58,539 --> 00:05:00,539
She has no behavior at all.

83
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:02,539
She touches meat with her fingers.

84
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:04,539
Sometimes I think I'm spinning.

85
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:06,539
I just miss the words.

86
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:08,443
So?

87
00:05:08,443 --> 00:05:11,443
It can't be that bad, because you talk a lot.

88
00:05:11,443 --> 00:05:14,443
Clara seems to like you very much, and that's all that counts.

89
00:05:14,443 --> 00:05:17,443
Clara is far too intelligent to like such a creature.

90
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:21,443
She brings in mice and cats and clumsy turntables.

91
00:05:21,443 --> 00:05:22,443
Turntables?

92
00:05:22,443 --> 00:05:24,443
Yes, can't believe it.

93
00:05:26,741 --> 00:05:29,741
Who knows what she's going to do the next day.

94
00:05:29,741 --> 00:05:32,741
And besides, she let Mrs. Clara free the bird.

95
00:05:32,741 --> 00:05:37,741
And then the buns. She stole buns every day and hid them in her closet.

96
00:05:37,741 --> 00:05:41,741
Sometimes she just disappears and no one knows where she's going.

97
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:45,741
No, no, she's a wild one and she's going to stay a wild one.

98
00:05:45,741 --> 00:05:48,741
Who knows how things are going at home.

99
00:05:48,741 --> 00:05:51,741
Do you know that she doesn't even know the alphabet?

100
00:05:51,741 --> 00:05:54,741
Sometimes I think she's not quite right in her head.

101
00:05:55,115 --> 00:05:58,115
You mean the child isn't normal?

102
00:05:58,115 --> 00:06:00,115
Yes, that's what I mean.

103
00:06:00,115 --> 00:06:03,115
In any case, there are all kinds of signs of it.

104
00:06:03,115 --> 00:06:06,115
She sometimes says such terrible things about goats and stones.

105
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:09,115
And just imagine, she can whistle on her fingers.

106
00:06:09,115 --> 00:06:13,115
I was just able to prevent her from teaching that to Mrs. Clara.

107
00:06:13,115 --> 00:06:16,115
She ruins my entire upbringing.

108
00:06:16,115 --> 00:06:19,115
If only you knew what we've been through here.

109
00:06:19,115 --> 00:06:22,115
I still doubt the child. I don't know what to do with her.

110
00:06:25,115 --> 00:06:25,584
To be continued...

111
00:06:25,584 --> 00:06:29,584
We have to come up with a name for the dolls.

112
00:06:29,584 --> 00:06:33,584
Oh, you did a good job.

113
00:06:40,624 --> 00:06:44,624
Well, you two pretty girls, are you having fun?

114
00:06:48,624 --> 00:06:51,624
Are you so nice to me and get me a glass of water from the kitchen?

115
00:06:51,624 --> 00:06:54,624
The glasses are standing, the glasses are standing, the glasses...

116
00:06:54,624 --> 00:06:56,624
Tinette knows what they are standing for.

117
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,624
Should I get cold water?

118
00:06:58,624 --> 00:07:01,624
Yes, ice-cold, clear, fresh water.

119
00:07:01,624 --> 00:07:03,624
I got it, I'm running fast.

120
00:07:07,624 --> 00:07:09,478
There, Clara.

121
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:13,478
I have a few important questions for you. Please answer them honestly.

122
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:18,478
Have you ever noticed something about Heidi that you think is strange?

123
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:22,478
Mrs. Rottenmeier is worried. She thinks Heidi wouldn't be completely normal.

124
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:27,478
A lot depends on your answer now. If she's right, we have to send Heidi home.

127
00:08:06,544 --> 00:08:10,244
Oh, no, Heidi is as normal as I am. She's a very sweet girl.

128
00:08:12,244 --> 00:08:15,044
What Miss Rottenmeier claims is not true.

129
00:08:15,044 --> 00:08:17,044
She just can't stand Heidi.

130
00:08:17,044 --> 00:08:18,544
I see.

131
00:08:18,544 --> 00:08:21,344
Heidi is just not used to living in a house and in a city.

132
00:08:21,344 --> 00:08:24,544
Miss Rottenmeier says she has not even learned the alphabet.

133
00:08:24,544 --> 00:08:26,344
Yes, she's right.

134
00:08:26,344 --> 00:08:30,344
But that's not because she's stupid. She just has to think about the mountains.
That's all.

135
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:32,044
She likes the mountains.

136
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:33,844
Heidi always thinks about the mountains?

137
00:08:33,844 --> 00:08:34,544
Yes.

138
00:08:34,566 --> 00:08:37,566
She doesn't feel well with us. She wants to go back to the mountains.

139
00:08:37,566 --> 00:08:39,566
She misses her goats and her friends.

140
00:08:39,566 --> 00:08:43,566
She wants to play with the dog and see the sunset and help her grandfather.

141
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:47,566
I see. It looks like she has a home-pain.

142
00:08:47,566 --> 00:08:51,566
But I don't want her to go back home. I like her.

143
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:56,566
Since she's here, everything is much nicer. I haven't been bored for a single
day.

144
00:08:56,566 --> 00:08:59,506
And she didn't mean it badly when she said the mice and the...

145
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:07,006
...cats were here in my room. She just wanted to be with her friends. She just
loves animals so much. Please, father, leave her here.

146
00:09:07,006 --> 00:09:10,006
You two really seem to have become friends.

147
00:09:10,006 --> 00:09:16,006
Oh yes, Heidi is the best friend in the world. You should hear what kind of
beautiful stories she can tell.

148
00:09:16,006 --> 00:09:20,506
And when she laughs, I always have to laugh with her. Let her play the dog.

149
00:09:20,506 --> 00:09:24,506
What is it, father? Where are you going? Please don't send her away.

150
00:09:24,506 --> 00:09:27,041
I think we'll keep Heidi here.

151
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:31,041
But I'd like to ask the others first before I make up my mind.

152
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:36,041
Sebastian, please send the little girl to me.

153
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,041
Yes, sir.

154
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:41,041
She must be down in the kitchen somewhere. I've sent her to get me some water.

155
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,041
I know.

156
00:09:57,041 --> 00:10:00,041
You've lost something. A sock.

157
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,041
This is the only thing left.

158
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,041
I'm sorry.

159
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,041
I'm sorry.

160
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:05,355
I'm sorry.

161
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:09,355
Thank you. Do me a favor. Put the socks in my shirt pocket.

162
00:10:09,355 --> 00:10:12,355
Yes. I did it.

163
00:10:12,355 --> 00:10:14,355
Thank you, child. Nice of you.

164
00:10:16,355 --> 00:10:20,355
Do you know if there is a fountain here where you can get fresh, cold water?

165
00:10:20,355 --> 00:10:23,355
Yes, I know. I'm on my way there. Come with me.

166
00:10:23,355 --> 00:10:24,355
Are you going to wash clothes there?

167
00:10:24,355 --> 00:10:27,355
So you ask questions. What else should I do there?

168
00:10:35,355 --> 00:10:39,355
Subtitles by Stephanie Geiges

169
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:42,659
If only you knew how much my back hurts.

170
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:46,659
Don't get too excited. I'm in the line now.

171
00:10:46,659 --> 00:10:48,659
It's getting more and more crowded.

172
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:53,659
And then she just fell into the hot water pot.

173
00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:55,659
We might have done it.

174
00:10:55,659 --> 00:10:57,659
Let me through. I just want to go to the fountain.

175
00:10:57,659 --> 00:10:59,659
Listen to how you get through on your own.

176
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,659
There's the fountain back there.

177
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:11,659
Let's go.

178
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:21,611
What are you standing around for? Kids have nothing to look for here.

179
00:11:34,155 --> 00:11:37,355
I can't even imagine where she went again now.

180
00:11:37,355 --> 00:11:39,355
You look over there, I'll look here.

181
00:11:39,355 --> 00:11:41,355
This girl is terrible.

182
00:11:43,855 --> 00:11:45,855
That's exactly what it is.

183
00:11:45,855 --> 00:11:48,855
One is not a second of the day safe in front of her stripes.

184
00:11:48,855 --> 00:11:53,355
She really has everything she needs, but no, she has to run away.

185
00:11:58,355 --> 00:12:01,355
Do you know where I can find a fountain?

186
00:12:01,382 --> 00:12:03,382
Always straight ahead and then to the right.

187
00:12:03,382 --> 00:12:04,382
Thank you.

188
00:12:09,382 --> 00:12:10,382
Imagine that.

189
00:12:10,382 --> 00:12:14,382
He actually threatened me with the announcement because the children are so
loud.

190
00:12:31,382 --> 00:12:35,382
There's a fountain! Hooray! Finally fresh water!

191
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,382
Ice cold!

192
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,390
As Mr. Sesemann wanted it to be.

193
00:12:48,486 --> 00:12:50,986
Good day, little girl.

194
00:12:50,986 --> 00:12:54,486
Can I have a sip of water too? It's hot in here.

195
00:12:56,486 --> 00:12:58,486
Yes, of course.

196
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,486
Please, here's my cup.

197
00:13:00,486 --> 00:13:02,486
Thank you.

198
00:13:05,446 --> 00:13:09,446
Does it taste good? Is the water cold enough?

199
00:13:09,446 --> 00:13:12,446
It's even very good.

200
00:13:13,446 --> 00:13:16,446
Here, your cup.

201
00:13:16,446 --> 00:13:18,446
Goodbye.

202
00:13:18,446 --> 00:13:20,446
Goodbye.

203
00:13:20,446 --> 00:13:23,446
You little one, where are you taking the water?

204
00:13:23,446 --> 00:13:25,446
To Mr. Sesemann.

205
00:13:25,446 --> 00:13:27,446
What? Where to, to Mr. Sesemann?

206
00:13:27,446 --> 00:13:30,446
I think he has running water in the house.

207
00:13:33,356 --> 00:13:36,756
There you walk through the whole city and get water and he has some.

208
00:13:37,756 --> 00:13:39,356
He doesn't have such water.

209
00:13:39,556 --> 00:13:42,956
He said I should get him water, but he wanted ice cold water.

210
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,356
And I did that.

211
00:13:44,556 --> 00:13:45,756
Then greet him nicely.

212
00:13:47,356 --> 00:13:49,356
I hope your water is cold enough for him.

213
00:13:49,556 --> 00:13:50,956
Goodbye, little girl.

214
00:13:51,156 --> 00:13:52,956
It was an honor for me to get to know you.

215
00:13:55,756 --> 00:13:57,156
Don't forget to greet.

216

217
00:14:04,742 --> 00:14:06,742
But then I told him my opinion.

218
00:14:06,742 --> 00:14:09,742
I told him, if you don't want my children to make noise,

219
00:14:09,742 --> 00:14:13,742
then I don't want your ugly dogs to bark from morning to night.

220
00:14:15,058 --> 00:14:19,058
I don't want your ugly dogs to bark from morning to night.

221
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:47,058
I don't want your ugly dogs to bark from morning to night.

222
00:14:47,302 --> 00:14:51,302
If she had gone out to catch some fresh air, she would have been here long ago.

223
00:14:51,302 --> 00:14:54,302
No, I have the feeling that this time she ran away.

224
00:14:54,302 --> 00:14:57,302
And that, now that you have come home.

225
00:14:57,302 --> 00:15:01,302
Oh, I have at least expected some gratitude, all your generosity for nothing.

226
00:15:01,302 --> 00:15:03,302
Believe me, finally, she is not normal.

227
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:05,302
The child is a danger.

228
00:15:08,302 --> 00:15:11,302
Tinette and I have searched the whole city for her, not to drive her away.

229
00:15:11,302 --> 00:15:13,302
So there we have the catastrophe.

230
00:15:13,687 --> 00:15:17,007
I will look for her myself. And thank you, God, if I find her.

231
00:15:17,007 --> 00:15:20,967
I beg you, Mr. Sesemann, send her away. It is not to be held back.

232
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:22,967
Sebastian, get the carriage ready.

233
00:15:34,807 --> 00:15:35,807
Heidi?

234
00:15:36,097 --> 00:15:37,097
Yes?

235
00:15:37,097 --> 00:15:39,597
Did you just get water? That took a long time.

236
00:15:39,597 --> 00:15:41,597
I didn't find a fountain first.

237
00:15:44,597 --> 00:15:45,597
Careful.

238
00:15:46,597 --> 00:15:51,597
Most of the fountains I found had so many people standing there, but they didn't
let me through.

239
00:15:51,597 --> 00:15:56,597
I'm sorry it took so long, but there was a man there who said the water would be
particularly good.

240
00:15:56,597 --> 00:15:58,597
Thank you very much, my child.

241
00:15:58,597 --> 00:16:01,597
You seem to have put a lot of effort into my water.

242
00:16:06,097 --> 00:16:08,097
Good.

243
00:16:08,353 --> 00:16:10,353
Is the water cold enough?

244
00:16:10,353 --> 00:16:12,353
Is the water cold enough?

245
00:16:12,353 --> 00:16:16,353
Yes, it's cold enough. It's the best water I've ever drunk.

246
00:16:21,353 --> 00:16:24,353
I was supposed to say hello. There was this man at the fountain.

247
00:16:24,353 --> 00:16:27,353
He said I shouldn't forget to say hello. He was a very nice man.

248
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:30,353
He had a walking stick with a horse head.

249
00:16:30,353 --> 00:16:32,353
Who could that be? Here, Sebastian.

250
00:16:32,487 --> 00:16:39,487
He had very white hair and he was very old. And he was very nice to me. And he
had this nice walking stick.

251
00:16:39,487 --> 00:16:41,487
The description fits the doctor.

252
00:16:41,487 --> 00:16:47,487
He has his walking stick. He will be very surprised that you send Heidi to get
water.

253
00:16:47,487 --> 00:16:50,487
The whole long way through the city for a single glass of water.

254
00:16:50,487 --> 00:16:53,487
Let's see what he says when he comes next time.

255
00:16:55,487 --> 00:16:57,487
What's so funny?

256
00:16:58,295 --> 00:17:00,295
I don't know why you're laughing so much.

257
00:17:00,295 --> 00:17:02,295
Yes, I believe you, my child.

258
00:17:10,817 --> 00:17:12,817
Bye!

259
00:17:13,197 --> 00:17:43,177
Come, bird, fly, sit down on my foot.

260
00:17:43,177 --> 00:17:51,177
There's a letter in the beak, a greeting from the mother.

261
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,660
Can I bother you, Mr. Sesemann?

262
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:09,660
Yes, of course. I wanted to talk to you anyway.

263
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:13,660
I have now decided to keep Heidi here with us.

264
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,660
Oh!

265
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,660
I watched Heidi go in the last few days.

266
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,660
She makes a completely normal impression on me.

267
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,660
Besides, Clara feels much better when she's there.

268
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,660
I am quite aware that you are having a hard time.

269
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,660
You can say that.

270
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,306
Yes, that's good.

271
00:18:28,306 --> 00:18:35,146
I know that you've been having a hard time lately, Mrs. Rottenmeier, and that
you can't get over Heidi without further ado.

272
00:18:35,146 --> 00:18:41,146
And to make it a little easier for you while I'm gone, I asked my mother to come
here.

273
00:18:41,146 --> 00:18:45,146
Oh, do you mean to say that Mrs. Sesemann is coming?

274
00:18:45,146 --> 00:18:47,146
That's what I meant to say.

275
00:18:47,146 --> 00:18:51,146
I appreciate what you're doing for us, and especially for my daughter.

276
00:18:51,146 --> 00:18:54,146
That's why I want my mother to help you.

277
00:18:54,146 --> 00:18:55,634
But...

278
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:59,634
My mother is familiar with children. You don't mind her coming, do you?

279
00:18:59,634 --> 00:19:03,634
No, no, no, no, Obeware. I appreciate your kindness.

280
00:19:03,634 --> 00:19:06,134
Why should I mind your mother coming?

281
00:19:06,134 --> 00:19:09,134
I'm very pleased. My mother will take the child away from you,

282
00:19:09,134 --> 00:19:12,134
and then you can take care of Clara. I thank you.

283
00:19:12,134 --> 00:19:16,634
You will see, this time, everything will be fine while I'm away in the house.

284
00:19:25,634 --> 00:19:30,634
THE END

285
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:33,036
Well, you two?

286
00:19:33,036 --> 00:19:36,036
That's your father, Clara. Good morning, Mr. Sesemann. Did you sleep well?

287
00:19:36,036 --> 00:19:39,036
Yes, I slept well. Good morning, Heidi.

288
00:19:39,036 --> 00:19:44,036
But Clara, don't be so sad. Didn't you like the last few weeks?

289
00:19:44,036 --> 00:19:47,036
Why weeks? It was only ten days again.

290
00:19:48,036 --> 00:19:52,036
I'll be back over the next month and then I'll definitely stay at home longer.

291
00:19:52,036 --> 00:19:54,036
I promise you.

292
00:19:54,036 --> 00:19:56,036
You never keep your promises.

293
00:19:56,594 --> 00:20:02,594
How many times have you said, this time you'll stay longer and then you'll pack
your suitcases again and you'll be gone.

294
00:20:12,594 --> 00:20:17,594
You can't do anything about it. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said all that.

295
00:20:17,594 --> 00:20:23,594
I'm really a rabid father, but I think this time I have a surprise for you that
you're looking forward to.

296
00:20:26,012 --> 00:20:30,012
Grandmother is coming! When is she coming? How long will she stay with us?

297
00:20:30,012 --> 00:20:31,012
Is she really coming?

298
00:20:31,012 --> 00:20:35,012
Yes, she is really coming. I don't know how long she will stay, but she has
already left the house.

299
00:20:35,012 --> 00:20:38,012
Well, now you are shining again, Clara.

300
00:20:38,012 --> 00:20:41,012
I thank you, Father. I love you so much.

301
00:20:41,012 --> 00:20:44,012
I love you too, my little one.

302
00:20:44,012 --> 00:20:46,012
Take good care of yourself, Clara.

303
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:48,012
Heidi is already taking care of me.

304
00:20:52,744 --> 00:20:54,744
Goodbye!

305
00:20:54,744 --> 00:20:56,744
Goodbye!

306
00:20:56,744 --> 00:20:58,744
Goodbye!

307
00:20:58,744 --> 00:21:00,744
Goodbye!

308
00:21:00,744 --> 00:21:02,744
Goodbye!

309
00:21:02,744 --> 00:21:04,744
Goodbye!

310
00:21:14,744 --> 00:21:16,744
Goodbye!

311
00:21:16,744 --> 00:21:18,744
Don't be sad, you two!

312
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:20,744
Goodbye!

313
00:21:20,744 --> 00:21:22,744
Never come back!

314
00:21:22,744 --> 00:21:24,744
Goodbye!

315
00:21:24,744 --> 00:21:26,744
Goodbye!

316
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,744
Goodbye!

317
00:21:36,744 --> 00:21:38,744
You, Clara!

318
00:21:39,447 --> 00:21:42,447
What kind of grandmother is that your father was talking about?

319
00:21:42,447 --> 00:21:44,447
My grandmother, who else?

320
00:21:45,447 --> 00:21:49,447
You will definitely like her. She is really very, very nice. Believe me.

321
00:21:51,447 --> 00:21:55,447
Peter also has a grandmother. You still know the white buns.

322
00:21:55,447 --> 00:22:01,447
My grandmother also likes white buns. You have to tell you about the other
grandmother.

323
00:22:01,949 --> 00:22:05,949
If you enjoy the story of your bun, you will definitely enjoy it.

324
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:08,949
My grandmother likes to laugh very much. Am I right?

325
00:22:08,949 --> 00:22:11,949
Yes, the kind lady is a very humorous old lady.

326
00:22:11,949 --> 00:22:14,949
She even hid the soup from the poorest teenager.

327
00:22:14,949 --> 00:22:18,949
And she even sewed the arms of his coat to Sebastian.

328
00:22:22,949 --> 00:22:26,949
Heidi, come back in. The candidate is already waiting for us in the classroom.

329
00:22:26,949 --> 00:22:28,949
I'll be right there.

330
00:22:31,949 --> 00:22:33,949
Yes, I'll be right there.

331
00:22:35,607 --> 00:22:39,607
Heidi was very, very curious about Clara's grandmother.

332
00:22:39,607 --> 00:22:42,607
If she was really as nice as Clara claimed?

333
00:22:42,607 --> 00:22:45,607
If only it had finally come to that.

334
00:22:49,607 --> 00:22:52,607
But it took a while for the grandmother to come.

335
00:22:52,607 --> 00:22:55,607
And Mrs. Rottenmeier and Mr. Candidate

336
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:58,607
were once again not finished with the child, as they expressed themselves.

337
00:22:58,607 --> 00:23:01,607
Heidi also came up with the strangest ideas a few times

338
00:23:01,607 --> 00:23:04,607
and told Clara wonderful stories from the mountains.

339
00:23:05,469 --> 00:23:12,469
Clara found it all very funny, but Miss Rottenmeier had no understanding of it
at all.

340
00:23:12,469 --> 00:23:17,469
When the long-awaited grandmother finally came, she brought a surprise for Clara
and Heidi,

341
00:23:17,469 --> 00:23:20,469
from which the two had never heard anything before.

342
00:23:20,469 --> 00:23:23,469
They didn't come out of the astonishment at all.

343
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:27,469
But we want to tell you about that in our next story.

344
