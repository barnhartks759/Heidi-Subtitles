00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:02,890
Hello and welcome back to my channel!

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:03,366
Today I will show you how to make a

3
00:00:03,366 --> 00:00:13,126
Horny

4
00:00:13,126 --> 00:00:20,246
Lullaby

5
00:00:20,246 --> 00:00:22,366
Heidi

6
00:00:22,366 --> 00:00:24,406
Heidi

7
00:00:24,406 --> 00:00:28,446
Your world are the mountains

8
00:00:28,446 --> 00:00:30,566
Heidi

9
00:00:30,566 --> 00:00:32,766
Heidi

10
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:36,766
because up here you are at home.

11
00:00:36,766 --> 00:00:40,766
Dark bees,

12
00:00:40,766 --> 00:00:44,766
green meadows in the sunshine,

13
00:00:44,766 --> 00:00:48,766
Heidi, Heidi,

14
00:00:48,766 --> 00:00:52,766
you need to be happy.

15
00:00:52,766 --> 00:01:05,766
Halaleli, Halaleli, Halaleli, Halaleli, Halaleli, Halaleli, Halaleli, Halaleli,
Halaleli, Halaleli, Halaleli.

16
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:09,766
Heidi, Heidi,

17
00:01:09,766 --> 00:01:11,766
come home.

18
00:01:11,766 --> 00:01:13,766
Find your happiness.

19
00:01:13,766 --> 00:01:18,766
Come back.

20
00:01:19,766 --> 00:01:22,266
Grandfather! Grandfather!

21
00:01:22,266 --> 00:01:22,766
Hey!

22
00:01:28,026 --> 00:01:31,026
Heidi, dear little Heidi, you are back at home.

23
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:36,026
Finally, finally, finally, finally.

24
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:52,026
My little girl, everything will be fine now.

25
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:56,378
I'm back. I came home.

26
00:01:56,378 --> 00:01:58,378
I know that now.

27
00:01:58,378 --> 00:02:01,378
But why? I don't know yet. What was it?

28
00:02:01,378 --> 00:02:03,378
Did they chase you away?

29
00:02:03,378 --> 00:02:05,378
But of course not.

30
00:02:05,378 --> 00:02:09,378
Clara, Mr. Sesemann, the grandmother, they were all very nice.

31
00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:11,378
Why then?

32
00:02:11,378 --> 00:02:14,378
I really wanted to come home again.

33
00:02:14,378 --> 00:02:16,378
I wanted to be back in the mountains.

34
00:02:16,378 --> 00:02:18,378
Here, with you.

35
00:02:18,378 --> 00:02:20,272
Home, Heidi?

36
00:02:20,272 --> 00:02:24,472
Sometimes I couldn't breathe at all and I had to cry all day.

37
00:02:24,472 --> 00:02:27,472
Not breathing and crying?

38
00:02:27,472 --> 00:02:30,072
Mrs. Rottenmeier forbade it.

39
00:02:30,072 --> 00:02:34,872
She didn't want Clara to get upset and Clara can really hurt you.

40
00:02:34,872 --> 00:02:38,472
She sits in the wheelchair all day. She can never get out.

41
00:02:38,472 --> 00:02:42,072
Clara's doctor then suddenly said I have to go home immediately.

42
00:02:42,072 --> 00:02:43,672
Clara's doctor?

43
00:02:43,672 --> 00:02:46,472
Are you sick, Heidi? Is something wrong?

44
00:02:46,472 --> 00:02:49,184
Not at all. I'm very healthy.

45
00:02:49,184 --> 00:02:53,184
I've got a letter from Mr. Sesemann in my head. Wait, I'll get it for you, okay?

46
00:02:55,184 --> 00:02:57,184
This child.

47
00:02:59,184 --> 00:03:01,184
Thank you.

48
00:03:02,184 --> 00:03:05,184
Please read the letter right away. Mr. Sesemann wants it.

49
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:07,184
And this is for you.

50
00:03:07,184 --> 00:03:09,184
Thank you.

51
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:12,184
You know what, grandfather? I'm thirsty.

52
00:03:12,184 --> 00:03:14,184
I'm running over to the fountain.

53
00:03:19,184 --> 00:03:21,184
Thank you.

54
00:03:23,377 --> 00:03:25,377
It tastes much better than cocoa.

55
00:03:25,377 --> 00:03:27,377
At best, I'll wash myself with it right away.

56
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,377
Still so cold.

57
00:03:34,377 --> 00:03:36,377
The valley.

58
00:03:42,545 --> 00:03:44,545
They're snoring.

59
00:04:10,513 --> 00:04:13,513
I've been waiting for this for so long.

60
00:04:18,673 --> 00:04:23,673
Sometimes I've kept the cuckoos that passed by the house for palm trees.

61
00:04:23,673 --> 00:04:26,673
Something so barbaric. Imagine that!

62
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:40,129
Then there probably wasn't any.

63
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:43,129
Not in the city, but outside in the forest there were some.

64
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:45,129
Just imagine that. No tree in front of the house.

65
00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:49,129
Now I understand why you said that. No trees in front of the house.

66
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:55,129
Heidi, do you also know exactly that you don't want to go back to Frankfurt?

67
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:57,129
Oh, how can you ask that?

68
00:04:57,129 --> 00:05:01,129
If I would have liked to have stayed in Frankfurt, then I would have been there.

69
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:04,129
Or do you not want to have me with you anymore?

70
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:07,129
What? You don't even know how much I would like to have you with me.

71
00:05:07,735 --> 00:05:09,735
How nice!

72
00:05:09,735 --> 00:05:11,735
What's wrong with you?

73
00:05:11,735 --> 00:05:13,735
Just a fly.

74
00:05:13,735 --> 00:05:15,735
Put on something.

75
00:05:15,735 --> 00:05:17,735
It's getting cold.

76
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:19,735
Did you come here like this?

77
00:05:19,735 --> 00:05:21,735
No, of course not.

78
00:05:21,735 --> 00:05:23,735
But I couldn't wear the dress I was wearing.

79
00:05:23,735 --> 00:05:25,735
That's better.

80
00:05:25,735 --> 00:05:27,735
The other dress was way too fine.

81
00:05:27,735 --> 00:05:29,735
Oh, really?

82
00:05:29,735 --> 00:05:31,735
When you first came here,

83
00:05:31,735 --> 00:05:33,735
you only had a shirt.

84
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:37,439
I just pulled the shirt out of Peter's hut.

85
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,439
Did you change anything inside?

86
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:49,439
No!

87
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,760
Yes, it's all the same as it was.

88
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,760
The table.

89
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,760
The fire.

90
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,760
Are you going to make cheese again soon?

91
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,760
Of course.

92
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,760
Then I can help you.

93
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,760
But this time I'll do it right.

94
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,760
Look what I've got in my closet for you.

95
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,760
My dress.

96
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,760
Here, put it on.

97
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,760
It looks so small.

98
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,376
Oh, I'm stuck.

99
00:06:26,376 --> 00:06:28,376
It became too small.

100
00:06:28,376 --> 00:06:30,376
And what now?

101
00:06:31,376 --> 00:06:33,376
I grew up in Frankfurt.

102
00:06:34,376 --> 00:06:36,376
At least that's what it looks like.

103
00:06:38,376 --> 00:06:40,376
I'm a ghost. I'm a ghost.

104
00:06:42,376 --> 00:06:44,376
That's not possible.

105
00:06:48,376 --> 00:06:50,376
Now I have to stay in this dress forever.

106
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:52,376
Forever not.

107
00:06:52,702 --> 00:06:56,202
I think I should help you get out of this dress before you suffocate me.

108
00:06:57,702 --> 00:07:00,202
I didn't even notice that I grew so much.

109
00:07:00,202 --> 00:07:03,202
It looks like I would need Clara's fine dresses.

110
00:07:03,202 --> 00:07:04,202
Where are they?

111
00:07:04,202 --> 00:07:06,702
Oh, I left them at the bakery in the village.

112
00:07:06,702 --> 00:07:07,702
Will you pick them up?

113
00:07:08,702 --> 00:07:09,702
Of course.

114
00:07:09,702 --> 00:07:12,702
Yes, I knew that and I told him that too.

115
00:07:13,202 --> 00:07:16,702
Well, he couldn't imagine that I would come.

116
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:17,702
Yes.

117
00:07:18,202 --> 00:07:19,702
Hooray!

118
00:07:22,702 --> 00:07:25,702
My bed!

119
00:07:28,328 --> 00:07:32,328
Aha! He did not lift it up.

120
00:07:35,328 --> 00:07:38,328
What have you done to my bed, Grandfather?

121
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,040
My bed isn't up there anymore.

122
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,040
I know. I've taken it down now, Heidi.

123
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,040
And why?

124
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,040
Because... because I...

125
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,040
How should I know that you're coming back so soon?

126
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,040
You left so happily back then.

127
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,040
So you thought the whole time that I'd never come home again.

128
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,040
That's right! You thought that!

129
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,040
Yes. Yes.

130
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,040
That's what I thought.

131
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,040
But sometimes I didn't even think about it.

132
00:08:08,318 --> 00:08:10,818
I just couldn't imagine it.

133
00:08:10,818 --> 00:08:13,818
I didn't want to imagine it.

134
00:08:13,818 --> 00:08:16,818
I was afraid you would have forgotten us.

135
00:08:16,818 --> 00:08:18,818
But Grandfather...

136
00:08:19,818 --> 00:08:22,818
I thought you were a little city girl.

137
00:08:24,818 --> 00:08:26,818
You're still my Heidi.

138
00:08:26,818 --> 00:08:28,818
And I'll always be.

139
00:08:29,818 --> 00:08:32,318
I can't imagine it any other way.

140
00:08:32,318 --> 00:08:34,818
Because here in the mountains you grew up.

141
00:08:34,818 --> 00:08:36,318
And this is where you belong.

142
00:08:36,318 --> 00:08:37,818
And not in the city.

143
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:38,782
Mom!

144
00:08:38,782 --> 00:08:42,782
And now we're making a new house for me. 小心, you'll fall. 小心,你會跌倒。

145
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,760
It's a beautiful day.

146
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,760
It smells good.

147
00:09:15,487 --> 00:09:17,487
Eilidh!

148
00:09:17,487 --> 00:09:19,487
Hurrah!

149
00:09:21,183 --> 00:09:26,183
It's just like my old bed.

150
00:09:26,183 --> 00:09:31,183
If only I could sleep.

151
00:09:31,183 --> 00:09:36,183
Grandfather.

152
00:09:36,183 --> 00:09:40,183
If only I could sleep.

153
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:44,127
Grandfather.

154
00:09:44,127 --> 00:09:46,127
Yes, Heidi?

155
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:49,127
You know, I also had a bed there.

156
00:09:49,127 --> 00:09:51,127
That's what I thought.

157
00:09:51,127 --> 00:09:53,127
But it wasn't very nice.

158
00:09:53,127 --> 00:09:55,127
Was it hard or was it wrong?

159
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:59,127
No, it wasn't. I couldn't sleep.

160
00:09:59,127 --> 00:10:01,127
You're crying?

161
00:10:01,127 --> 00:10:04,127
Because I have to be so happy! I'm crying because I'm so happy!

162
00:10:08,127 --> 00:10:12,127
I don't know what's going on with me either. I have to cry and I have to laugh.

163
00:10:12,127 --> 00:10:14,127
All at once!

164
00:10:16,127 --> 00:10:16,671
Cheers!

165
00:10:16,671 --> 00:10:18,671
Father, I loved you.

166
00:10:18,671 --> 00:10:20,171
I loved you too, child.

167
00:10:24,171 --> 00:10:26,171
Isn't Peter coming?

168
00:10:27,763 --> 00:10:29,763
Yes, indeed!

169
00:10:48,763 --> 00:10:49,763
Peter!

170
00:10:51,763 --> 00:10:52,763
Heidi!

171
00:10:52,763 --> 00:10:55,763
Peter! Peter!

172
00:10:56,763 --> 00:10:57,763
Peter!

173
00:10:59,763 --> 00:11:00,763
Hurray!

174
00:11:09,763 --> 00:11:11,763
Oh, that can't be!

175
00:11:11,763 --> 00:11:13,763
Why didn't anyone say that?

176
00:11:13,763 --> 00:11:14,763
Heidi!

177
00:11:14,763 --> 00:11:15,763
Sven!

178
00:11:15,763 --> 00:11:16,763
Bernie!

179
00:11:16,763 --> 00:11:17,763
I came back home!

180
00:11:17,763 --> 00:11:18,763
Good day!

181
00:11:18,763 --> 00:11:19,763
Good day!

182
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,763
The kids are so scary!

183
00:11:22,763 --> 00:11:23,763
No!

184
00:11:27,763 --> 00:11:29,763
Well, my little ones, good day!

185
00:11:31,763 --> 00:11:33,763
Why are you screaming so loudly?

186
00:11:33,763 --> 00:11:34,763
There he is!

187
00:11:34,763 --> 00:11:35,763
Good day! I'm here!

188
00:11:38,763 --> 00:11:41,763
Well, tell me, aren't you happy at all?

189
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:46,335
You still look exactly the same as you used to.

190
00:11:46,335 --> 00:11:48,335
Yes, how else should I look?

191
00:11:48,335 --> 00:11:51,335
Not quite, I've grown a little.

192
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,335
Say something so I can believe it.

193
00:11:53,335 --> 00:11:57,335
Yes, sure. My name is Heidi and I've finally come home.

194
00:11:58,827 --> 00:12:00,827
Great!

195
00:12:16,827 --> 00:12:18,827
Why doesn't anyone tell me you're home?

196
00:12:18,827 --> 00:12:20,827
Why doesn't anyone tell me you're home?

197
00:12:20,827 --> 00:12:22,827
I don't know.

198
00:12:22,827 --> 00:12:24,827
Hooray!

199
00:12:28,827 --> 00:12:30,827
The green one is Snuggie!

200
00:12:30,827 --> 00:12:32,827
The green one is Snuggie!

201
00:12:32,827 --> 00:12:34,827
Snuggie, stay here!

202
00:12:34,827 --> 00:12:36,827
What is it? You don't know me anymore!

203
00:12:36,827 --> 00:12:38,827
What is it? You don't know me anymore!

204
00:12:38,827 --> 00:12:40,827
Why don't you turn around, Heidi?

205
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:42,230
Why?

206
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:45,230
You're running away with the doll's daughter all the time!

207
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,230
No!

208
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,230
But you're a shi-

209
00:12:54,262 --> 00:12:56,262
You've become a beautiful, big goat.

210
00:12:56,262 --> 00:12:59,262
Now I definitely don't want to sell you to anyone.

211
00:13:02,262 --> 00:13:04,262
Then you have to be Snooki's daughter.

212
00:13:04,438 --> 00:13:07,438
Hello, little white goat. My name is Heidi.

213
00:13:08,438 --> 00:13:10,438
How cute!

214
00:13:11,438 --> 00:13:14,134
Don't stay too long. It's going to get dark soon.

215
00:13:14,134 --> 00:13:17,134
We have to go now. Will you come with us to our garden tomorrow?

216
00:13:17,134 --> 00:13:19,134
Of course. What did you think?

217
00:13:23,134 --> 00:13:25,134
It's starting again.

218
00:13:25,134 --> 00:13:27,134
Get in motion!

219
00:13:27,134 --> 00:13:28,134
We'll be there soon!

220
00:13:28,134 --> 00:13:30,134
Come on, what's wrong with you? We'll see each other tomorrow.

221
00:13:30,134 --> 00:13:32,134
Now go with him!

222
00:13:32,134 --> 00:13:33,134
Come on!

223
00:13:33,134 --> 00:13:34,134
Get up!

224
00:13:35,862 --> 00:13:38,862
What now? It's just like it used to be!

225
00:13:42,862 --> 00:13:45,862
Are you going to move now?

226
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:50,862
Goodbye, Heidi!

227
00:13:50,862 --> 00:13:52,862
Goodbye, Peter!

228
00:13:52,862 --> 00:13:53,862
Wait!

229
00:13:53,862 --> 00:13:55,862
No, no, not again!

230
00:13:59,862 --> 00:14:00,862
A swan?

231
00:14:00,862 --> 00:14:01,862
Go!

232
00:14:01,862 --> 00:14:02,862
Go and get it!

233
00:14:02,862 --> 00:14:04,862
Hey, you lazy faggot!

234
00:14:05,654 --> 00:14:08,654
You're right, they already know where they belong.

235
00:14:10,654 --> 00:14:13,654
Do you still know how to milk goats or have you learned it in the meantime?

236
00:14:13,654 --> 00:14:15,654
Learned, milking?

237
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:17,654
You haven't done it for a long time.

238
00:14:17,654 --> 00:14:18,654
Well and?

239
00:14:18,654 --> 00:14:19,654
Learned.

240
00:14:19,654 --> 00:14:21,654
Good day you two, how are you?

241
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:24,654
Swinley?

242
00:14:25,654 --> 00:14:26,654
What's wrong with Swin...

243
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,870
What could it be?

244
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,870
She suddenly looks like an old pillow.

245
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,870
Did she eat too much?

246
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,870
Swinley? Oh, come on.

247
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,870
She's all right. She's healthy, that's all.

248
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,870
She's having a baby!

249
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,870
Oh, yes, Swinley.

250
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,870
And I took a picture.

251
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,870
Nothing has changed.

252
00:14:45,186 --> 00:14:47,186
I took a picture.

253
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,501
But that tasted good.

254
00:15:21,501 --> 00:15:22,501
Anything else, please?

255
00:15:22,501 --> 00:15:23,501
Anything else?

256
00:15:23,501 --> 00:15:24,501
That's already the third bowl.

257
00:15:24,501 --> 00:15:26,501
Won't that be too much for you?

258
00:15:26,501 --> 00:15:28,501
Oh no, definitely not.

259
00:15:28,501 --> 00:15:32,501
I haven't had fresh goat's milk in so long, Grandfather.

260
00:15:32,501 --> 00:15:35,501
There must have been other food for that.

261
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:36,501
Yes, there was.

262
00:15:36,501 --> 00:15:39,501
But it didn't taste as good as the cheese here.

263
00:15:40,501 --> 00:15:42,501
Well, that's just how it is.

264
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:44,501
Fresh mountain air always makes you hungry.

265
00:15:44,501 --> 00:15:45,501
That's all.

266
00:15:45,907 --> 00:15:50,907
No, there was only salad and pudding fried with sauce and jam rolls.

267
00:15:50,907 --> 00:15:53,907
But it didn't taste that good.

268
00:15:54,907 --> 00:15:57,907
In the afternoon there was always cake and cocoa to drink.

269
00:15:57,907 --> 00:16:01,907
And I always had to eat everything, even though I didn't like it at all.

270
00:16:01,907 --> 00:16:03,907
What do you say about that?

271
00:16:03,907 --> 00:16:07,907
It's really not very nice there. Even the clouds look completely different than
our clouds.

272
00:16:07,907 --> 00:16:11,907
There are no eagles. I haven't even seen a rooster yet.

273
00:16:11,907 --> 00:16:14,907
They don't even have a dog. And no cats either.

274
00:16:15,171 --> 00:16:18,171
Not even holy enough, that's good.

275
00:16:19,171 --> 00:16:21,171
Miss Rottenmeier didn't want to have it.

276
00:16:21,171 --> 00:16:23,171
Forget it, Miss Rottenmeier.

277
00:16:27,693 --> 00:16:30,693
I think you like the cheese bread.

278
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,693
Did something fall in there?

279
00:16:36,693 --> 00:16:38,693
Someone looked through the window.

280
00:16:38,693 --> 00:16:40,693
Through the window?

281
00:16:41,693 --> 00:16:45,693
You must have been mistaken. There was definitely no one there.

282
00:16:47,693 --> 00:16:49,693
Yes, there was someone again.

283
00:16:49,693 --> 00:16:51,693
Is there someone?

284
00:16:57,693 --> 00:17:03,693
What was that?

285
00:17:03,693 --> 00:17:05,693
I don't know.

286
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,693
Why are you driving around here in the middle of the night?

287
00:17:12,693 --> 00:17:14,693
Peter, can't you knock?

288
00:17:15,693 --> 00:17:16,693
Yes, I can.

289
00:17:19,693 --> 00:17:20,693
Just because...

290
00:17:22,693 --> 00:17:23,693
Because of what?

291
00:17:24,693 --> 00:17:25,693
Something important.

292
00:17:26,693 --> 00:17:28,693
That this is supposed to be for you.

293
00:17:28,693 --> 00:17:29,693
For me?

294
00:17:29,693 --> 00:17:31,693
I hope you like it. These are your favorite nuts.

295
00:17:31,693 --> 00:17:33,693
That's nice of you, Peter.

296
00:17:33,843 --> 00:17:35,843
I think so, too.

297
00:17:37,643 --> 00:17:40,843
You think so? Come on, General Siegen, come on in.

298
00:17:41,843 --> 00:17:44,843
Don't be like that. Come on in.

299
00:17:44,843 --> 00:17:47,843
You used to eat with us, too.

300
00:17:47,843 --> 00:17:51,843
Yes, but that was before.

301
00:17:51,843 --> 00:17:53,843
You weren't here anymore.

302
00:17:53,843 --> 00:17:55,843
Without you, I only dared to open the door.

303
00:17:55,843 --> 00:17:58,411
It was all so different all of a sudden.

304
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:01,611
I didn't know if your grandfather still knew me, so do you know...

305
00:18:03,211 --> 00:18:04,811
Come here, you two, sit down.

306
00:18:05,011 --> 00:18:07,611
I don't understand a word of what you want to say.

307
00:18:07,811 --> 00:18:08,611
Later.

308
00:18:08,811 --> 00:18:10,811
Psst, I can't talk so well now.

309
00:18:11,011 --> 00:18:12,211
Is that why...

310
00:18:12,411 --> 00:18:15,411
After you were gone, he didn't talk to me anymore.

311
00:18:15,611 --> 00:18:18,611
When I brought the goats, he always looked at me in a bad way.

312
00:18:18,811 --> 00:18:20,011
Grandfather?

313
00:18:23,274 --> 00:18:27,274
That has to happen to me!

314
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:30,274
Why don't you two sit down next to me?

315
00:18:30,274 --> 00:18:32,274
Where did you want to eat the world?

316
00:18:32,274 --> 00:18:36,274
And you, Peter, you're always hungry when I remember correctly.

317
00:18:36,274 --> 00:18:39,274
So what is it? I can't ask for more than that.

318
00:18:39,338 --> 00:18:40,538
He's changed.

319
00:18:40,538 --> 00:18:41,438
He's always like that.

320
00:18:41,438 --> 00:18:44,638
He hasn't changed at all. And you're a coward.

321
00:18:44,638 --> 00:18:46,338
Could be. Yes, maybe.

322
00:18:46,338 --> 00:18:48,338
Do you think he'll stay so friendly with me?

323
00:18:48,338 --> 00:18:51,338
Mhm. But only if you finally sit down.

324
00:18:51,838 --> 00:18:53,338
You go first.

325
00:18:54,138 --> 00:18:55,338
The pipe!

326
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,038
Where is it?

327
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:01,338
Well...

328
00:19:01,338 --> 00:19:03,838
There, Peter. I brought it with me.

329
00:19:05,538 --> 00:19:07,338
No, I can't accept that.

330
00:19:07,338 --> 00:19:08,826
Why?

331
00:19:08,826 --> 00:19:12,826
Actually, I wanted to give you a pipe, but you must have lost it somewhere.
Heidi, let go!

332
00:19:12,826 --> 00:19:17,826
You can accept that. Yes, for sure. Please accept it, please.

333
00:19:17,826 --> 00:19:21,826
You don't need that, Heidi. Thank you very much.

334
00:19:21,826 --> 00:19:27,826
Are you finally coming or not? I'm still here. Or have you forgotten that I'm
sitting here and waiting?

335
00:19:27,826 --> 00:19:30,826
I just want to say something. I'll pick you up tomorrow, okay?

336
00:19:30,826 --> 00:19:32,282
Peter!

337
00:19:32,282 --> 00:19:36,782
Well, tell me, do you want to go without eating? You're not sick, are you?

338
00:19:36,782 --> 00:19:39,782
No, but you used to stay here all the time.

339
00:19:39,782 --> 00:19:43,282
I promised your grandmother to come home soon.

340
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:45,282
Aha.

341
00:19:46,282 --> 00:19:50,282
Even if there's cheese and fresh bread and dried meat?

342
00:19:50,282 --> 00:19:52,282
Meat?

343
00:19:54,282 --> 00:19:55,626
No, thank you very much.

344
00:19:55,626 --> 00:19:58,126
It looks good, but I should still go home.

345
00:19:58,126 --> 00:20:00,126
Why don't you take anything with you? Put it in the basket.

346
00:20:00,126 --> 00:20:02,126
That doesn't work.

347
00:20:04,126 --> 00:20:05,126
Why not?

348
00:20:17,126 --> 00:20:18,116
There!

349
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:22,116
There was a star, Schnuppe. Now I can wish for something.

350
00:20:27,116 --> 00:20:28,116
What did you wish for?

351
00:20:28,388 --> 00:20:29,888
I'm not going to tell you.

352
00:20:29,888 --> 00:20:31,388
I can understand.

353
00:20:31,388 --> 00:20:33,388
Will you really stay here?

354
00:20:33,388 --> 00:20:35,888
I'll never go on in my life.

355
00:20:35,888 --> 00:20:37,388
Say hello to your grandmother!

356
00:20:37,388 --> 00:20:38,388
I will!

357
00:20:38,388 --> 00:20:40,688
Goodbye Peter! See you tomorrow! Get me out of here!

358
00:20:40,688 --> 00:20:42,688
Up! Up your legs!

359
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,208
See you tomorrow!

361
00:21:19,688 --> 00:21:21,688
Grandfather?

362
00:21:24,187 --> 00:21:26,187
You have to sleep now.

363
00:21:26,187 --> 00:21:28,187
I'm not tired.

364
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:30,187
Are you happy too?

365
00:21:30,187 --> 00:21:32,187
Yes, my child, very happy.

366
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:47,351
Thank you for watching and see you in the next video.

00:22:47,515 --> 00:22:56,515
The next morning Heidi went right after sunrise for the first time in a long,
long time with Peter and the goats up on the meadow.

368
00:22:56,515 --> 00:23:02,515
Again and again Heidi shouted loudly. It was as if she had never seen all of
this before.

369
00:23:02,515 --> 00:23:07,515
The mountains, the clouds, the meadows. Heidi could not grasp her luck.

370
00:23:09,515 --> 00:23:14,417
For hours she lay in the meadow with Peter and enjoyed the sunbeams.

371
00:23:14,417 --> 00:23:17,717
For Heidi, a dream had come true.

372
00:23:17,717 --> 00:23:22,117
Even an eagle saw her on her first day up here on the alp.

373
00:23:22,117 --> 00:23:26,117
But we want to tell you about that in our next story.
