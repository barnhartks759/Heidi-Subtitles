1
00:01:19,066 --> 00:01:25,066
When Heidi was one year old, her parents died and since then Heidi grew up with
Aunt Dete.

2
00:01:25,066 --> 00:01:32,066
She lived with her aunt for four years and all the time she believed that Aunt
Dete was her only relative.

3
00:01:32,066 --> 00:01:38,066
But all of a sudden everyone was talking about a mysterious grandfather, about
the old Almy.

4
00:01:38,066 --> 00:01:42,066
And Heidi was brought to this grandfather.

5
00:01:46,874 --> 00:01:50,874
Heidi must stay with you. I have found a job in Frankfurt.

6
00:01:50,874 --> 00:01:52,874
Out!

7
00:01:52,874 --> 00:01:53,874
Go!

8
00:01:53,874 --> 00:01:55,874
Get out of my sight!

9
00:01:55,874 --> 00:01:57,874
And never let yourself be seen up here again!

10
00:01:57,874 --> 00:02:01,874
And dare to disturb my peace on the Alps ever again in my life!

11
00:02:07,066 --> 00:02:09,066
Good-bye, Heidi.

12
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:12,066
It will be all right.

13
00:02:16,066 --> 00:02:18,066
Live well, Aunt Dede!

14
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:41,770
So you left her here, Dede. How could you just leave such a little child like
Heidi up there at the old gravestone?

15
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,770
That was not right of you.

16
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,770
What should I do?

17
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,770
Something, but not that.

18
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:54,770
Where should I go with her? I have loved Heidi with all my heart.

19
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,770
Do you think it's easy for me?

20
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,770
I know it's bad.

21
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,770
I'm young, Babel. I'm only 26 years old.

22
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,800
Since my sister died, I've been taking care of Heidi like a mother.

23
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,800
We hardly had money to live, Babel.

24
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,800
For the first time, I've found the right position.

25
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,800
In Frankfurt, Babel, you don't belong here.

26
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,800
Take her with you.

27
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,800
What am I supposed to do in Frankfurt with Heidi when I'm working?

28
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,800
You all have no idea!

29
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:06,590
I'm afraid we have to do something with you.

30
00:04:10,366 --> 00:04:15,366
If you can't think of anything better, you could show me the house from the
inside.

31
00:04:16,366 --> 00:04:19,366
Maybe that's the best idea at the moment.

32
00:04:20,366 --> 00:04:22,366
Collect your clothes and come with me.

33
00:04:23,366 --> 00:04:25,366
Why do I need my clothes?

34
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:32,790
What kind of a strange child are you?

35
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,790
Don't children need any clothes?

36
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,790
Yes, but my clothes just bother me when I jump.

37
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:38,790
Watch out!

38
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,790
That's what I learned from the goats.

39
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,790
Still, it's better to bring your clothes home.

40
00:05:08,222 --> 00:05:13,222
- Do you still fit in there? - If you give it your all, yes.

41
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:25,990
What a huge pot. Cheese. I think it smells like cheese. Right? - Yes, it does.

42
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:29,990
Since you live alone, you probably cook yourself, don't you? - Yes.

43
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:33,990
From now on, I'll cook for you, grandfather.

44
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:40,990
Oh, hard. That must be your bed. But where should I sleep? - Wherever you want.

45
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:45,642
I can't sleep in the cheese pot, can I?

46
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:50,110
Why don't you look for a place you like?

47
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,110
You think so?

48
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:55,110
Well, if you think so, I'll take a look around.

49
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,730
Oh, it smells good in here.

50
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,730
I want to sleep here.

51
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,730
Oh, yes.

52
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:18,730
Oh, it's beautiful up here.

53
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:25,730
Grandfather, look how incredibly beautiful it is up here.

54
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,730
I know.

55
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:31,730
Well, what happened?

56
00:06:39,682 --> 00:06:42,682
Nobody in the world has such a bed. Only me, Heidi.

57
00:06:42,682 --> 00:06:46,682
I thought you dropped the ladder. What's going on?

58
00:06:46,682 --> 00:06:49,682
I like it. It smells so good. It's the most beautiful bed in the world.

59
00:06:49,682 --> 00:06:52,682
I always want to sleep here.

60
00:06:52,682 --> 00:06:55,682
Here and nowhere else.

61
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:59,682
Up here I'll make my bed. And what kind of bed?

62
00:07:03,554 --> 00:07:06,554
I hope you have a bed sheet for me.

63
00:07:06,554 --> 00:07:08,554
Without a bed sheet it's not possible.

64
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:11,554
Or have you ever seen a bed without a bed sheet?

65
00:07:11,554 --> 00:07:14,554
That's good. I'll go and get one.

66
00:07:16,554 --> 00:07:20,554
I saw it from the beginning. It's a strange child.

67
00:07:21,554 --> 00:07:23,554
Hurry up, Grandfather!

68
00:07:28,226 --> 00:07:31,226
You have to get used to it. We have plenty of time up here.

69
00:07:31,226 --> 00:07:34,226
That may be true, but today we all have to go to bed for the first time.

70
00:07:34,226 --> 00:07:35,226
Hooray!

71
00:07:35,226 --> 00:07:37,226
And this one doesn't have any.

72
00:07:38,226 --> 00:07:40,226
It seems that we can't do it without help.

73
00:07:44,226 --> 00:07:46,226
What are you doing now?

74
00:07:51,906 --> 00:07:53,906
I understand.

75
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:54,906
A little better, isn't it?

76
00:07:54,906 --> 00:07:55,906
Yes.

77
00:07:55,906 --> 00:07:58,906
Soft, wonderfully soft.

78
00:07:58,906 --> 00:08:00,906
So you can do that.

79
00:08:00,906 --> 00:08:02,906
Attention!

80
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,410
You wanted to have it, didn't you?

81
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:14,410
Yes, partly, but there's something missing.

82
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:19,410
Most beds have bed sheets, but also bed covers.

83
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:22,410
That will be difficult. I'm not equipped for guests.

84
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:25,410
That doesn't matter. Then we'll just take more straw for it.

85
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,410
- It's enough. - Wait, I have an idea.

86
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:36,410
Do you think you can sleep in there as well as in a sleeping bag?

87
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,410
We'll see.

88
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,106
Now I know what you mean, Grandfather.

89
00:08:46,106 --> 00:08:47,106
Beautiful.

90
00:08:48,106 --> 00:08:49,106
Do you think it will work?

91
00:08:49,106 --> 00:08:53,106
But yes, why not? It's much nicer than I imagined it to be.

92
00:08:54,106 --> 00:08:57,106
If only it was already night, Grandfather, so I could go to bed.

93
00:08:58,106 --> 00:09:00,106
Do you think you can see the stars?

94
00:09:01,106 --> 00:09:03,106
Yes, if you look through the hatch.

95
00:09:04,106 --> 00:09:08,106
If there are no clouds in the sky, then you can see a thousand and a thousand
stars.

96
00:09:09,106 --> 00:09:10,106
Do you think so?

97
00:09:10,524 --> 00:09:14,524
Do you think so, grandfather? I can hear the birds singing in the trees in the
morning.

98
00:09:14,524 --> 00:09:18,524
You will hear the birds and also the wind when it ripples in your window.

99
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:20,524
Do you really think so?

100
00:09:20,524 --> 00:09:22,524
I know everything very well.

101
00:09:23,524 --> 00:09:28,524
The wind ripples in your window. Sometimes very quietly, sometimes a little
loudly.

102
00:09:28,524 --> 00:09:32,524
But then don't be afraid of it. That's just the way it is to say good day.

103
00:09:32,524 --> 00:09:37,524
The wind can tell a lot. It comes from far away. So listen to it, Heidi.

104
00:09:38,172 --> 00:09:40,672
You don't believe how many stories he knows.

105
00:09:40,672 --> 00:09:42,672
Do you really mean it?

106
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,672
So you didn't mean it honestly.

107
00:09:54,672 --> 00:09:56,672
Of course I meant it honestly.

108
00:09:59,672 --> 00:10:01,672
Then I'm relieved.

109
00:10:02,672 --> 00:10:03,672
Nice.

110
00:10:03,672 --> 00:10:06,124
But why did you have to laugh just now?

111
00:10:06,124 --> 00:10:11,124
Because I, old donkey, just realized that I like someone.

112
00:10:11,124 --> 00:10:13,124
Then you'll definitely give me something to eat.

113
00:10:13,124 --> 00:10:16,124
You're right to remind me of food.

114
00:10:16,124 --> 00:10:18,124
It's time for us to cook something.

115
00:10:21,124 --> 00:10:23,124
Now that was the feared AlmÃ¶hi.

116
00:10:23,124 --> 00:10:26,124
Heidi could, after she had met her grandfather,

117
00:10:26,124 --> 00:10:31,124
no longer understand why everyone in the village was afraid of him.

118
00:10:31,124 --> 00:10:34,124
Maybe just because he was different from the others?

119
00:10:54,246 --> 00:10:58,246
The cheese is getting very soft. It looks strange, but it smells good.

120
00:11:24,038 --> 00:11:27,038
It looks very cozy.

121
00:11:27,038 --> 00:11:31,038
There is only one little thing on the table.

122
00:11:31,038 --> 00:11:33,038
You forgot something for this.

123
00:11:33,038 --> 00:11:34,038
Yes?

124
00:11:39,974 --> 00:11:41,974
Do you mean this one?

125
00:11:41,974 --> 00:11:43,974
Yes, that's good.

126
00:11:43,974 --> 00:11:45,974
Such a big one.

127
00:11:45,974 --> 00:11:47,974
But my hunger is also big.

128
00:11:49,974 --> 00:11:51,974
Do children always eat while standing?

129
00:11:51,974 --> 00:11:53,042
No.

130
00:12:00,042 --> 00:12:04,042
Well, then it would be better if we covered it on the floor.

131
00:12:06,042 --> 00:12:08,042
Better than nothing.

132
00:12:08,042 --> 00:12:10,042
My first table of my own.

133
00:12:10,042 --> 00:12:12,042
Please, a lot.

134
00:12:16,042 --> 00:12:19,042
I bet I can do it without leaving anything behind.

135
00:12:25,706 --> 00:12:31,706
Well, what did I say? All at once, without leaving anything behind.

136
00:12:31,706 --> 00:12:36,706
The milk is from our own goats. You can't get anything fresher. Do you think you
can get more?

137
00:12:36,706 --> 00:12:40,706
Of course. Who is that?

138
00:12:42,706 --> 00:12:47,706
I totally forgot about him. Come, come, come.

139
00:12:55,498 --> 00:12:57,498
What's your name?

140
00:12:57,498 --> 00:12:59,498
This is Joseph.

141
00:12:59,498 --> 00:13:01,498
Isn't he a little too big?

142
00:13:01,498 --> 00:13:05,498
I mean, you can have five children for such a dog.

143
00:13:05,498 --> 00:13:10,498
Here in the mountains we need such dogs, but you'll have to learn that.

144
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,498
Hello, Joseph.

145
00:13:34,826 --> 00:13:36,826
But is this one big?

146
00:13:38,826 --> 00:13:40,826
These dogs are called Bernadines.

147
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:21,458
Aunt Dede once had a dog, a very fat one with short legs.

148
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:23,458
He used to go for walks with me.

149
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,206
Wake up!

150
00:14:36,874 --> 00:14:38,874
Excuse me, please.

151
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:49,466
Stay here, butterfly, stay here!

152
00:14:49,466 --> 00:14:50,774
Then I'll put you in my arms.

153
00:14:58,318 --> 00:15:00,318
What a pity!

154
00:15:03,886 --> 00:15:05,886
Hm, there he is!

155
00:15:05,886 --> 00:15:07,886
Now then!

156
00:15:07,886 --> 00:15:09,886
Nothing again!

157
00:15:09,886 --> 00:15:11,886
Wait, I'll catch you!

158
00:15:11,886 --> 00:15:13,886
If only I could fly!

159
00:15:13,886 --> 00:15:15,886
So will you finally wait now?

160
00:15:17,886 --> 00:15:19,886
Haha, yes!

161
00:15:21,886 --> 00:15:23,886
Come in and put on something warm!

162
00:15:23,886 --> 00:15:25,886
In the evening it gets cold!

163
00:15:25,886 --> 00:15:27,886
Shut up!

164
00:15:29,886 --> 00:15:31,886
Grandfather?

165
00:15:32,388 --> 00:15:34,888
What's that supposed to be, what you're doing there?

166
00:15:34,888 --> 00:15:37,888
- You can guess three times, my child. - What do you mean?

167
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:50,026
Grandfather, you're building a chair for me, so I can sit at the table when we
want to eat together.

168
00:15:50,026 --> 00:15:52,526
That's my shawl.

169
00:15:54,526 --> 00:15:56,526
I hope you like it.

170
00:15:56,526 --> 00:15:59,526
Oh, thank you very much.

171
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:01,526
Why shouldn't I like it?

172
00:16:02,526 --> 00:16:04,526
Joseph, Joseph!

173
00:16:05,526 --> 00:16:11,526
I have a shawl, I have a shawl, a shawl, a shawl of my own, all for myself.

174
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:14,972
He will only wake up when he gets something to eat.

175
00:16:14,972 --> 00:16:16,972
Don't give him any trouble.

176
00:16:17,972 --> 00:16:18,972
Attention!

177
00:16:27,598 --> 00:16:44,598
For Heidi, everything was just wonderful. She was happy about her own bed, high
up in the room, about the butterflies, the meadows and the mountains. Heidi was
happy. For the first time in her life, she understood what it means to be at
home somewhere.

178
00:16:46,598 --> 00:16:50,598
For heaven's sake, keep sleeping. I didn't want to. I'm sorry.

179
00:16:56,398 --> 00:16:58,398
Did I hurt you?

180
00:17:04,462 --> 00:17:07,462
Hey, I'll live with you from today.

181
00:17:07,462 --> 00:17:11,462
If we become friends, you can save your bone. That's much more comfortable.

182
00:17:16,846 --> 00:17:23,026
Joseph, I talked to you. Now open your eyes.

183
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,450
Where have you been all this time?

184
00:18:33,074 --> 00:18:36,074
- What's your name? - The white one is Swenley and the brown one is Barry.

185
00:18:39,074 --> 00:18:42,074
- Why are they licking? - He's got salt on his hands.

186
00:18:42,074 --> 00:18:45,074
- Goats really like that. - Give me something too.

187
00:18:46,074 --> 00:18:49,074
A whole handful of salt for you, Swenley.

188
00:18:52,074 --> 00:18:55,074
- That tickles. - I couldn't stand it.

189
00:18:55,074 --> 00:18:58,074
What is it, General? Don't you want to move on with your goats?

190
00:18:58,074 --> 00:19:02,074
- Yes, oh, uh, what do you mean? - I'll be back tomorrow, Heidi.

191
00:19:25,682 --> 00:19:28,882
Just tell me you don't know that there's goat milk, too. Here, take a look.

192
00:19:28,882 --> 00:19:31,082
What? I'm supposed to drink that?

193
00:19:31,082 --> 00:19:34,082
You've even had that before, today at the table.

194
00:19:35,282 --> 00:19:38,238
I actually liked it quite a bit.

195
00:20:06,002 --> 00:20:08,002
What's going on now?

196
00:20:08,002 --> 00:20:10,002
Where's the wind coming from?

197
00:20:47,698 --> 00:20:49,698
Hey, what did you say?

198
00:20:50,698 --> 00:20:52,698
I was sent to the mountains, forever!

199
00:20:53,698 --> 00:20:55,698
If you want to play, stay in the house, but be quiet.

200
00:20:56,698 --> 00:20:58,698
Not that something happens outside.

201
00:20:58,698 --> 00:21:00,698
Later they will take away my right to care for you.

202
00:21:00,698 --> 00:21:02,698
Did you understand me?

203
00:21:25,334 --> 00:21:28,214
Why is she up there? Is she afraid?

204
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:37,974
Heidi was certainly not afraid. She had only been on the island for one day and
it was as if she had spent her whole life here.

205
00:22:37,974 --> 00:22:43,974
The hut, the wind, the moon over the mountains, Heidi had always dreamed of all
of this.

206
00:22:47,862 --> 00:22:53,622
She didn't know anything about what she would experience, who and what she would
meet.

207
00:22:53,622 --> 00:23:00,622
She had already met Peter and his goat herd, but she didn't know the names of
the flowers yet and the tabernacles.

208
00:23:00,622 --> 00:23:03,622
There's your goat, Peter.

209
00:23:03,622 --> 00:23:07,622
She knew so little about this world that was so new to her.

210
00:23:07,622 --> 00:23:12,622
She knew nothing about the animals and the people who live here and she didn't
know, above all,

211
00:23:12,622 --> 00:23:17,622
how quickly she would win her grandfather, the grey-haired old Almy, in love.

212
00:23:17,622 --> 00:23:17,740
To be continued

213
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:21,740
But we want to tell you about that in our next story.
