1
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,410
We don't seem to be there for you at all.

2
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,410
For us, you've completely blown yourself up.

3
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:30,410
That's not mean.

4
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,410
He has a girlfriend now.

5
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,410
Do you mean the strange little girl up there at the almshouse?

6
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,410
That's exactly what I mean. The strange little girl.

7
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,410
She's not strange at all.

8
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,410
Of course she is.

9
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,410
Everyone who has an affair with the old man up there is not quite normal.

10
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,410
She is normal.

11
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,410
Everyone can say that.

12
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,410
I want to swear that your girlfriend has the same long beard as the old man.

13
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,206
No, she doesn't have a beard.

14
00:02:52,058 --> 00:02:56,058
And at some point you want to have a full beard too.

15
00:02:56,058 --> 00:02:57,958
You think so?

16
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:16,681
You haven't seen her lately, Peter. How's the little girl?

17
00:03:16,681 --> 00:03:17,681
Good.

18
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:20,681
Why don't you bring her down to the village?

19
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:23,681
She likes it up there. What's she doing here?

20
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:25,681
She likes it?

21
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:41,049
I won't let go of my strange feeling.

22
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:44,049
There can't be anything to do with right things up there.

23
00:04:11,649 --> 00:04:13,649
You've already woken up.

24
00:04:15,649 --> 00:04:16,649
Are you alright?

25
00:04:31,457 --> 00:04:33,457
And tell me later what you say!

26
00:04:46,657 --> 00:04:48,657
- You could have waited! - Are you awake already?

27
00:04:48,657 --> 00:04:50,657
Yes, of course! Why not?

28
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,657
Give me the bucket!

29
00:04:52,657 --> 00:04:53,657
Why?

30
00:04:53,657 --> 00:04:55,657
Let me milk the two today!

31
00:04:55,657 --> 00:04:57,657
Peter can always milk them!

32
00:04:57,657 --> 00:04:59,657
Peter is a goat herder, he learned it!

33
00:04:59,657 --> 00:05:02,657
And? I'm a goat herder!

34
00:05:02,657 --> 00:05:05,657
- Since when? - Since this morning! I'll prove it to you!

35
00:05:06,657 --> 00:05:07,657
Bucket!

36
00:05:07,657 --> 00:05:09,657
The bucket!

37
00:05:09,657 --> 00:05:11,657
So, here we go!

38
00:05:13,657 --> 00:05:15,657
Something like this is certainly quite simple!

39
00:05:16,657 --> 00:05:17,133
Subtitles by Stephanie Geiges

40
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:22,449
She doesn't have any milk at all!

41
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,833
Yes, she has milk, quite a lot even!

42
00:05:37,025 --> 00:05:40,325
I think you've been a goat herder since this morning, who knows everything.

43
00:05:40,325 --> 00:05:42,825
Maybe she doesn't want to be milked this morning.

44
00:05:42,825 --> 00:05:45,825
She wants to, but she's not a master yet.

45
00:05:45,825 --> 00:05:47,125
Not a milking master either.

46
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:50,425
That's not how hard it can be to milk. I'll learn it.

47
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:55,025
That can only lie in the bucket.

48
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,525
I want to make it!

49
00:06:01,525 --> 00:06:03,025
Oh, I could do it!

50
00:06:04,525 --> 00:06:05,425
Ouch!

51
00:06:05,425 --> 00:06:07,625
Can't you stand still when I'm milking you?

52
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:20,360
- That's not nice of you. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to yell at you, Bärli.

53
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,960
- What does she mean? - She's jealous, she wants to be mulled.

54
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,960
- You think so? - Yes, they both like you very much.

55
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,160
What's wrong with you? Leave me alone, leave me alone!

56
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,360
What's going on? Help me! Take her away!

57
00:06:41,406 --> 00:06:47,406
Finally, Bärli. Now it's enough. Back to the bucket.

58
00:06:49,406 --> 00:06:51,406
Finally.

59
00:06:51,406 --> 00:06:55,406
A strange goat here, because she's happy when the goats are gone.

60
00:07:02,664 --> 00:07:05,664
If only I knew how you do that!

61
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,400
So Heidi went up to the meadow with Peter like every morning

62
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:29,400
And like every morning, this day seemed to her to be even more beautiful than
yesterday

63
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,400
Come!

64
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,928
And how did you like my first goat whistle?

65
00:07:43,928 --> 00:07:45,928
I didn't hear a whistle at all.

66
00:07:45,928 --> 00:07:47,928
No? Stop it!

67
00:07:54,888 --> 00:07:57,888
I think something's wrong with my fingers. I think something's wrong with my
fingers.

68
00:08:09,608 --> 00:08:20,408
While Heidi was trying to prove to her friend Peter that she could become a good
goat herder, the Almöhi was preparing to go down into the village

69
00:08:21,108 --> 00:08:29,208
Twice a year he went down the road to sell the bowls and spoons that he cut out
of wood during the long winter months

70
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:35,708
And to trade the goat cheese that he made from the milk of Swanley and Bearley
for butter

71
00:08:37,864 --> 00:08:40,864
Come on, Joseph, get up!

72
00:08:42,864 --> 00:08:44,864
Your movements are doing well.

73
00:08:49,256 --> 00:08:51,256
And then he stays there.

74
00:09:04,975 --> 00:09:08,975
- What do you think I'm thinking? - Since when can you read your mind?

75
00:09:09,975 --> 00:09:16,975
- It's already afternoon. Na na na afternoon. Na na na afternoon. Na na na
afternoon. Na na na afternoon. - Come back down to earth!

76
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:21,975
- Well done! - But you still haven't said what I was thinking.

77
00:09:22,975 --> 00:09:25,975
- I'm whistling! - If you want.

78
00:09:26,975 --> 00:09:28,975
Now you'll experience something!

79
00:09:37,199 --> 00:09:40,199
If I can't whistle, I'll just drive them away!

80
00:10:47,215 --> 00:10:50,215
Three? Why did I only get three?

81
00:11:00,335 --> 00:11:02,335
That's not unfair of you!

82
00:11:02,335 --> 00:11:05,335
Why? I think you want to be the goat all day long.

83
00:11:05,335 --> 00:11:08,335
I do, but I can't do it with the counting.

84
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:09,335
Then let it be.

85
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:09,915
No!

86
00:11:13,615 --> 00:11:15,615
Let it go, give it a shot, Lea!

87
00:11:15,615 --> 00:11:16,123
Let me go!

88
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,379
He never allowed me to do that. You'll just find out now.

89
00:11:22,579 --> 00:11:23,579
No, definitely not!

90
00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:33,859
You can't even whistle properly on your finger. How are you going to milk goats
there?

91
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:38,859
One thing has nothing to do with the other. You just have to explain to me how
to do it.

92
00:11:38,859 --> 00:11:42,859
I don't even think about that. You said you can do it.

93
00:11:43,859 --> 00:11:47,859
Fine, whatever you want. Then I'll eat everything alone in the future.

94
00:11:47,859 --> 00:11:50,359
No, that's not possible. - Why not?

95
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:53,359
Because you always notice so much that it's enough for two.

96
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:55,359
Then say please and help me.

97
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,870
What do you say to that?

98
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,870
I haven't seen him in half an eternity.

99
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,870
You used to be very good friends with his son.

100
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,870
Why don't you go over there and say hello?

101
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,870
I don't even think about it.

102
00:12:20,854 --> 00:12:24,854
Alma, come quickly to the window. Down there goes this disgusting Almy.

103
00:12:25,854 --> 00:12:27,854
Is he alone or is the child with him?

104
00:12:27,854 --> 00:12:28,854
Alone, of course.

105
00:12:28,854 --> 00:12:31,854
Too bad, I would have liked to see the little one again.

106
00:12:31,854 --> 00:12:33,854
I'm sure he won't give you anything to eat.

107
00:12:38,854 --> 00:12:40,854
You'll never believe that.

108
00:12:41,854 --> 00:12:43,854
No, you can't believe that either.

109
00:12:43,854 --> 00:12:45,854
What does he want here?

110
00:12:46,902 --> 00:12:50,902
Yes, who are we to welcome to our church?

111
00:12:50,902 --> 00:12:52,902
Good day, priest. How are you?

112
00:12:52,902 --> 00:12:56,902
Why don't you step in for a moment and visit your neighbor's house?

113
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:59,902
Did you expect him to come to church?

114
00:12:59,902 --> 00:13:02,902
He hasn't been seen in there for years.

115
00:13:02,902 --> 00:13:05,902
He actually left the child alone in the mountains.

116
00:13:05,902 --> 00:13:08,902
I told you that she was making a mistake.

117
00:13:08,902 --> 00:13:11,902
You can't just leave a little child to an old man.

118
00:13:11,902 --> 00:13:14,902
Yes, yes, young and old don't get along.

119
00:13:16,902 --> 00:13:17,794
Yes, that's true.

120
00:13:23,158 --> 00:13:25,158
No, the almshouse is there.

121
00:13:25,158 --> 00:13:27,158
Haven't seen you in a long time.

122
00:13:27,158 --> 00:13:29,158
How do you always do it? What do the mountains do?

123
00:13:31,158 --> 00:13:33,158
As always, do you like the same bread?

124
00:13:33,158 --> 00:13:35,158
Yes.

125
00:13:35,158 --> 00:13:37,158
Go and get it quickly.

126
00:13:37,158 --> 00:13:39,158
They say you have a little girl up there now.

127
00:13:39,158 --> 00:13:41,158
Yes, Heidi.

128
00:13:41,158 --> 00:13:43,158
What is she doing, the poor little one?

129
00:13:43,158 --> 00:13:45,158
That's not enough, there's one more missing.

130
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,158
What? There are only three breads.

131
00:13:47,158 --> 00:13:49,158
But I always gave you that much for the cheese.

132
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:54,340
I live up there alone in the mountains, but that's why I still haven't lost my
soul.

133
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:57,340
Do you want to say that we're cheating on you? Say something!

134
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:02,340
Oh yes, I remember that. We've raised the prices since the last time we were in
Durflea.

135
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,340
You can see how long you haven't been down here.

136
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:10,340
If you two pretend that you can cheat on me, then you're mistaken.

137
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,804
Do you want to say we're cheating?

138
00:14:11,804 --> 00:14:14,604
You guessed it. That's exactly what I wanted to say.

139
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:17,304
I warn you, Almöhn, take it back immediately.

140
00:14:17,304 --> 00:14:20,304
Everyone here in Dörfli knows that we're honorable people.

141
00:14:20,304 --> 00:14:22,304
Even my father was a baker here.

142
00:14:23,804 --> 00:14:25,804
I've always understood that.

143
00:14:25,804 --> 00:14:29,304
The word "honorable" that you take into account has always suited him.

144
00:14:29,304 --> 00:14:31,304
So, that's it for today.

145
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,790
I have the stupid feeling that we have gone too far this time.

146
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,790
We have been deceived in him.

147
00:14:57,501 --> 00:15:07,501
So it happened that the Alm-Öhi, only because he had been annoyed by the baker,
went to the city of Mayenfeld for the first time in many years.

148
00:15:07,501 --> 00:15:11,501
He couldn't say how long he wasn't down here anymore.

149
00:15:11,501 --> 00:15:16,501
But, and that surprised him, nothing had changed here in the meantime.

150
00:15:30,557 --> 00:15:33,557
What's wrong with you, Peter? Did you hurt yourself?

151
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,557
I have such a terrible stomachache.

152
00:15:35,557 --> 00:15:38,557
That too! What am I going to do now?

153
00:15:38,557 --> 00:15:41,557
That's counterfeit! You ate all the cheese on your own!

154
00:15:41,557 --> 00:15:43,557
But it tasted so good!

155
00:15:43,557 --> 00:15:47,557
You can't have a stomachache now! We have to bring the goats back to the
village!

156
00:15:48,557 --> 00:15:51,557
Peter, get up! Get yourself together!

157
00:17:32,637 --> 00:17:36,637
Why are you crying like that? Nothing happened, did it?

158
00:17:37,637 --> 00:17:40,265
You know what? I don't have a stomachache anymore.

159
00:17:43,485 --> 00:17:47,485
I think I have a stomachache because I was so scared.

160
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:59,010
Oh, it's gone again, Peter.

161
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,010
When did you learn that?

162
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:05,680
I can whistle. I can whistle just as well as a...

163
00:19:33,956 --> 00:19:38,956
What does he want in the village? I'm sure he exchanges cheese for bread.

164
00:19:38,956 --> 00:19:41,776
Do you do that sometimes?

165
00:19:52,516 --> 00:19:55,116
Hello, Peter. Is Heidi already in the hut?

166
00:19:55,316 --> 00:19:57,316
I delivered her, like every night.

167
00:19:57,516 --> 00:20:00,316
That's good. I don't want her running around in the evening.

168
00:20:00,516 --> 00:20:02,316
Don't do that.

169
00:20:03,116 --> 00:20:05,316
He was actually in the village.

170
00:20:12,228 --> 00:20:17,228
I'd like to surprise my grandfather. He doesn't know that I'm a shepherd since
today.

171
00:20:19,228 --> 00:20:20,228
It works!

172
00:20:31,972 --> 00:20:33,972
I have a surprise for you!

173
00:20:33,972 --> 00:20:35,972
I have to show you something! You will be amazed when you see it!

174
00:20:35,972 --> 00:20:38,432
Come! Over there! Come with me! I show it to you!

175
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:47,444
Peter showed it to me!

176
00:20:54,345 --> 00:20:57,345
You can whistle? I don't believe that!

177
00:20:57,345 --> 00:20:59,345
I already thought you wouldn't believe me!

178
00:20:59,345 --> 00:21:01,345
But you will be amazed! Listen carefully!

179
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,345
Do you believe it now?

180
00:21:06,345 --> 00:21:08,345
Can you whistle too?

181
00:21:08,345 --> 00:21:11,345
Whoever is up here winning has to be able to whistle!

182
00:21:11,345 --> 00:21:13,345
Then whistle!

183
00:21:20,075 --> 00:21:22,075
Whistle again!

184
00:21:42,347 --> 00:21:48,347
You don't have to listen to so much music, my child, if this is supposed to be
the most beautiful music in the world.

185
00:21:48,347 --> 00:21:49,347
It could be.

186
00:21:49,347 --> 00:21:51,347
It certainly is.

187
00:21:51,347 --> 00:21:54,347
How does our goat like this?

188
00:21:56,347 --> 00:21:58,347
Did you bring it with you?

189
00:21:59,347 --> 00:22:02,347
This is a sugar luch. I've never had one before.

190
00:22:02,347 --> 00:22:04,347
Then it's about time.

191
00:22:06,347 --> 00:22:08,347
It tastes very good.

192
00:22:08,347 --> 00:22:10,347
It tastes wonderful.

193
00:22:11,339 --> 00:22:14,339
But we're not quite there before dinner.

194
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:16,339
I'll try.

195
00:22:22,603 --> 00:22:25,603
Grandfather, it's nice here.

196
00:22:25,603 --> 00:22:30,603
Once again, a day had passed when Heidi was happy all around.

197
00:22:30,603 --> 00:22:34,603
The new world up here in the mountains, which she was curious about at first,

198
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:38,603
and which she was also a little afraid of, had become her world.

199
00:22:38,603 --> 00:22:42,603
Here in the little hut, she was at home.

200
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:56,299
Since Heidi was there, of course, something has changed for the Almöhi.

201
00:22:56,299 --> 00:23:00,299
He continued to do his field work and take care of the goats.

202
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:04,299
But in the house, he tried to see Heidi after the right one very soon.

203
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:08,299
Of course, she still went to the pasture with Peter every day.

204
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:14,299
But with all the fun of the new adventures she experienced, she never forgot her
duties as a housewife.

205
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:17,299
And she took these duties very seriously.

206
00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:21,299
But we want to tell you about this in our next story.
