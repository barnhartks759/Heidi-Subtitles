00:00:04,462 --> 00:00:09,462
Holadio

2
00:00:12,462 --> 00:00:17,462
Holadio

3
00:00:20,462 --> 00:00:24,462
Heidi, Heidi

4
00:00:24,462 --> 00:00:28,462
Your world are the mountains

5
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:32,462
Heidi, Heidi

6
00:00:32,462 --> 00:00:36,462
Because up here you are at home

7
00:00:36,462 --> 00:00:40,462
Dark berries

8
00:00:40,462 --> 00:00:44,462
Green meadows in the sunshine

9
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:48,462
Heidi, Heidi

10
00:00:48,462 --> 00:00:52,462
You need to be happy

11
00:00:52,462 --> 00:00:54,462
Holadio, Holadio

12
00:00:54,462 --> 00:00:56,462
Holadio, Holadio

13
00:00:56,462 --> 00:00:58,462
Holadio, Holadio

14
00:00:58,462 --> 00:01:00,462
Holadio, Holadio

15
00:01:00,462 --> 00:01:02,462
Holadio, Holadio

16
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:04,462
Holadio, Holadio

17
00:01:04,462 --> 00:01:06,462
Holadio, Holadio

18
00:01:06,462 --> 00:01:08,462
Holadio, Holadio

19
00:01:08,462 --> 00:01:10,462
Holadio, Holadio

20
00:01:10,462 --> 00:01:12,462
Holadio, Holadio

21
00:01:12,462 --> 00:01:14,462
Holadio, Holadio

22
00:01:14,462 --> 00:01:16,462
Holadio, Holadio

23
00:01:16,462 --> 00:01:18,462
Holadio, Holadio

24
00:01:18,462 --> 00:01:20,462
Holadio, Holadio

25
00:01:20,462 --> 00:01:21,370
Holadio, Holadio

26
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:25,370
The mother is standing on the stove.

27
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,370
It's not a goat stove, it's a kitchen stove.

28
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,370
Where is the stove?

29
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:32,370
Aha.

30
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,370
On the stove.

31
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,370
Stir in the pot.

32
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,994
And she stirs in the pot, because she's packing a...

33
00:01:39,994 --> 00:01:48,794
cake. For that you need flour, milk, sugar. Flour, milk and sugar. The whole
sentence, you

34
00:01:48,794 --> 00:01:54,534
moron. You need flour, milk and sugar. The mother. Flour, milk and a mother.

35
00:02:05,562 --> 00:02:07,562
Are you coming with us today, Heidi?

36
00:02:07,562 --> 00:02:10,562
No, I can't. Look how it's snowing again.

37
00:02:10,562 --> 00:02:11,562
Yes.

38
00:02:15,562 --> 00:02:19,562
Do you think it will stop snowing again at some point?

39
00:02:19,562 --> 00:02:20,562
Hey, I have an idea.

40
00:02:20,562 --> 00:02:21,562
Which one?

41
00:02:21,562 --> 00:02:24,562
Come with me home and warm yourself up.

42
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:26,562
That's a good idea for the first time.

43
00:02:35,562 --> 00:02:43,562
That. That was good. Thank you.

44
00:02:52,986 --> 00:02:54,986
It never stops today.

45
00:02:56,186 --> 00:02:58,986
Don't you think, Peter, that the grandmother is already waiting for you?

46
00:02:58,986 --> 00:03:01,586
I don't know. I think you have to go.

47
00:03:01,586 --> 00:03:03,186
What? He's still cutting!

48
00:03:03,186 --> 00:03:05,186
If I don't run now, I won't get through.

49
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:07,186
Wait a minute, okay?

50
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:08,186
Why?

51
00:03:08,186 --> 00:03:11,386
I want you to take a letter for the grandmother.

52
00:03:11,386 --> 00:03:12,786
From whom?

53
00:03:12,786 --> 00:03:14,786
From me! From who else?

54
00:03:21,646 --> 00:03:26,646
Do you know if you can write a snow storm in front of the door?

55
00:03:26,646 --> 00:03:29,646
If you don't even know that, how should I know that?

56
00:03:29,646 --> 00:03:33,646
What are you thinking about? Maybe you'll come up with one.

57
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:35,646
I don't like it.

58
00:03:45,646 --> 00:03:48,646
Promise me you won't forget to hand over the letter.

59
00:03:48,646 --> 00:03:49,588
I'll hand it over.

60
00:03:49,588 --> 00:03:50,188
Certainly.

61
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,388
Goodbye, see you tomorrow!

62
00:03:51,388 --> 00:03:54,388
Come home safely! Goodbye!

63
00:03:54,426 --> 00:03:56,426
Everything's covered in snow! Wet!

64
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,426
Good day! I'm home!

65
00:04:22,426 --> 00:04:24,426
Please!

66
00:04:24,426 --> 00:04:26,426
This is not to be stopped!

67
00:04:26,426 --> 00:04:27,534
There's already snowing all over the place!

68
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:28,534
What day is it?

69
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:30,534
Did Heidi come with you?

70
00:04:30,534 --> 00:04:35,534
Of course not. She can't do that today. It's snowing way too much. A meter high.

71
00:04:35,534 --> 00:04:40,534
Yes, of course. If it snows like you say, it's way too dangerous.

72
00:04:40,534 --> 00:04:43,534
Oh, I have a notebook with me. For you, grandmother.

73
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:45,534
From school?

74
00:04:45,534 --> 00:04:49,534
No. From Heidi. There. Here.

75
00:04:49,534 --> 00:04:54,068
This Heidi. She knows exactly that I can't read.

76
00:04:54,068 --> 00:04:58,068
Yes, we both forgot that earlier.

77
00:04:58,068 --> 00:05:02,068
I've never been to school. You have to read it yourself.

78
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,068
There's definitely nothing in it.

79
00:05:04,068 --> 00:05:09,068
There's definitely something in the letter. Why else would Heidi have written
it?

80
00:05:09,068 --> 00:05:12,068
Yes, I don't know.

81
00:05:12,068 --> 00:05:21,068
Dear Grandmother, I wanted to come today, but I...

82
00:05:21,604 --> 00:05:25,604
I'm snowing in a snowstorm, it's a pity.

83
00:05:25,604 --> 00:05:31,604
As soon as it stops snowing, I'll come up.

84
00:05:31,604 --> 00:05:35,604
Promised is promised.

85
00:05:35,604 --> 00:05:37,604
What kind of writing is that?

86
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:40,604
Promised and will not be broken.

87
00:05:40,604 --> 00:05:45,604
I would have liked to come today, but...

88
00:05:51,604 --> 00:05:55,604
I'm snowing in a snowstorm, it's a pity.

89
00:05:55,604 --> 00:05:58,604
What kind of writing is that?

90
00:05:58,604 --> 00:06:01,604
I would have liked to come today, but...

91
00:06:01,604 --> 00:06:05,604
I'm snowing in a snowstorm, it's a pity.

92
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,050
DADDY IS GONNA DIE

93
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,050
DADDY IS GONNA DIE

94
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,050
DADDY IS GONNA DIE

95
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,050
Now don't be so mean.

96
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,050
You forgot it too.

97
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,050
It has nothing to do with it.

98
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:20,050
You know exactly how hard it is to read.

99
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,050
That's what makes me mad.

100
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,050
Don't pretend, what was that?

101
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,050
You don't know how you write.

102
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,050
I know, my writing is not beautiful.

103
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:33,050
But I think that you can please your blind grandmother without pretending
afterwards.

104
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,360
Yeah!

105
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,660
Are you done now? Did you tell Peter everything you meant?

106
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,360
Yeah!

107
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,360
Mhm. I also told him everything I meant.

108
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,360
You can write another letter.

109
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,360
But then write a very short one with two sentences that I can learn by heart.

110
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,860
I think I know what we're doing with you.

111
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,360
We're giving you Heidi's thick fairy tale book to read.

112
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,360
Heidi's fairy tale book? No!

113
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,860
I also learned with it. It was very easy.

114
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,360
Yeah, uh, forget it. I have to go now.

115
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,900
Peter, if they hear you, they'll think it hurts to learn to read.

116
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,900
Come with me, you'll get a warm cheese on the way.

117
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,400
No, come on, Peter!

118
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,400
But only if you read the book in the closet.

119
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,900
You coward!

120
00:07:27,266 --> 00:07:29,266
Should we play now or not?

121
00:07:29,266 --> 00:07:31,266
Play!

122
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,090
It's your turn, now do it!

123
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:51,090
You sleepyhead, this is my little piece of wood.

124
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,090
Like this?

125
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:54,090
Oh come on, let's stop it.

126
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,090
Don't you feel like it anymore?

127
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,090
Yes, but you don't.

128
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,090
All you do is watch your grandfather.

129
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:01,090
You don't care about the game at all.

130
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,090
Do you find it so exciting what I'm doing here?

131
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:07,090
I've never seen her doing it before.

132
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,090
Well then come on, try it.

133
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,090
Let's see if you can do it.

134
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,090
Yes, can I really do it?

135
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:15,192
Yes, if you want to.

136
00:08:18,892 --> 00:08:19,892
All the best.

137
00:08:19,892 --> 00:08:20,892
Yes, thank you.

138
00:08:38,192 --> 00:08:39,732
Grandfather, he dropped something.

139
00:08:39,746 --> 00:08:41,746
You can call it that, too.

140
00:08:43,746 --> 00:08:45,746
Really very good, Peter.

141
00:08:45,746 --> 00:08:47,746
He's really good at that, isn't he?

142
00:08:47,746 --> 00:08:49,746
Not good enough for a long time, but it works.

143
00:08:49,746 --> 00:08:52,746
Yes, for the beginning it's already very good.

144
00:08:52,746 --> 00:08:54,746
Really very skillful.

145
00:09:31,558 --> 00:09:33,558
Good money!

146
00:09:34,422 --> 00:09:34,922
Heidi!

147
00:09:34,922 --> 00:09:35,922
This year you win!

148
00:09:35,922 --> 00:09:36,422
I think so!

149
00:09:36,422 --> 00:09:36,922
Yes!

150
00:09:36,922 --> 00:09:39,922
But only if this time who goes through the finish line last wins.

151
00:09:39,922 --> 00:09:41,922
Who goes through the finish line last?

152
00:09:41,922 --> 00:09:42,922
Is this a race?

153
00:09:42,922 --> 00:09:43,422
Uh-huh.

154
00:09:43,422 --> 00:09:44,422
Not a race.

155
00:09:44,422 --> 00:09:46,422
There will be a sled race again.

156
00:09:46,422 --> 00:09:46,922
Like every year.

157
00:09:46,922 --> 00:09:47,422
Yes?

158
00:09:47,422 --> 00:09:48,422
I'm in!

159
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,422
And you'll see, I'm the winner!

160
00:09:50,422 --> 00:09:50,922
What?

161
00:09:50,922 --> 00:09:51,422
No way!

162
00:09:51,922 --> 00:09:53,422
You'll be amazed!

163
00:09:53,422 --> 00:09:55,422
I'm really good at sledding.

164
00:09:55,422 --> 00:09:56,422
Ask Peter!

165
00:09:56,422 --> 00:09:57,422
Yes, ask him!

166
00:09:59,922 --> 00:10:00,922
What's wrong with them?

167
00:10:00,922 --> 00:10:02,422
Why are they laughing like that?

168
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,990
Did I say something wrong?

169
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,990
Girls don't take part in this.

170
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,990
It's only for boys.

171
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,990
And that's what you like?

172
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,990
Good morning.

173
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,990
Dude, there's a sled race.

174
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,990
There's a sled race every year. Why?

175
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,990
I know, but this year it's a special race.

176
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,990
A girl is taking part for the first time.

177
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,990
Why?

178
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,990
I'm taking part. It's easy.

179
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,990
You must be crazy.

180
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,990
We'll see.

181
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,318
Come on.

182
00:10:35,318 --> 00:10:37,318
But we were always together.

183
00:10:37,318 --> 00:10:39,318
I don't participate in the race, either.

184
00:10:39,318 --> 00:10:41,318
Why?

185
00:10:50,318 --> 00:10:52,318
If I'm not there, you can go with me.

186
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,318
No, I can't.

187
00:10:53,334 --> 00:10:55,334
Of course, and you win too.

188
00:10:55,334 --> 00:10:57,334
If I don't participate, I can't win either.

189
00:10:57,334 --> 00:10:59,334
Why? I don't understand you. You're very good at it.

190
00:10:59,334 --> 00:11:01,334
And with which sled?

191
00:11:01,334 --> 00:11:02,334
Peter!

192
00:11:02,334 --> 00:11:05,334
Should I participate in a race with this orange box?

193
00:11:06,334 --> 00:11:10,334
Then we have to get another sled if it doesn't work.

194
00:11:10,334 --> 00:11:11,334
What do you mean?

195
00:11:11,334 --> 00:11:12,334
Oh, I see.

196
00:11:12,334 --> 00:11:16,334
Do you think I always drive with this car because I enjoy it so much?

197
00:11:16,334 --> 00:11:18,334
That's a sled!

198
00:11:22,294 --> 00:11:26,294
How am I supposed to get across there?

199
00:11:26,294 --> 00:11:30,294
Peter, the grandfather has enough wood for a sled.

200
00:11:30,294 --> 00:11:31,294
And?

201
00:11:31,294 --> 00:11:34,294
What would he give me right now? You need that for his toys.

202
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:37,294
How do you want to know that now, before you asked?

203
00:11:37,294 --> 00:11:39,294
Do you dare?

204
00:11:39,294 --> 00:11:42,294
Why not? I think he'll give us the wood for sure.

205
00:11:42,294 --> 00:11:44,294
But then you have to help him with the sled.

206
00:11:44,294 --> 00:11:46,294
But that's very difficult.

207
00:11:46,294 --> 00:11:49,294
Where do you get that from? Come with me, we'll ask him.

208
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:56,246
To be continued...

209
00:11:56,246 --> 00:11:58,246
Yes, I can understand that very well.

210
00:11:58,246 --> 00:12:03,246
Exactly. You should have seen the other sleds. They are fast.

211
00:12:03,246 --> 00:12:07,246
There is only one thing that helps. We have to make a faster sled.

212
00:12:07,246 --> 00:12:10,246
Yes, hurray! You said it right.

213
00:12:10,246 --> 00:12:15,246
You can have wood under one condition. Peter makes the sled himself.

214
00:12:15,246 --> 00:12:18,246
Yes, he will help you.

215
00:12:19,246 --> 00:12:21,246
What do I need?

216
00:12:26,032 --> 00:12:28,032
That's nice.

217
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:36,416
With zeal Heidi and Peter went to work to build the sled.

218
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:40,416
They sawed and hammered and were not tired of painting themselves

219
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:44,416
as Peter would drive through the destination as the first with the self-made
sled.

220
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:49,416
The grandfather supervised the work. From time to time he helped them with a
wheel.

221
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:52,416
But that was all he contributed to the sled building.

222
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:57,416
Peter could be proud of himself, because he was really very skillful.

223
00:13:01,674 --> 00:13:08,674
And then the fox said to the goose and what do you think how the goose would be
happy if Peter could also listen.

224
00:13:12,674 --> 00:13:13,674
Peter!

225
00:13:13,674 --> 00:13:14,674
Yes?

226
00:13:14,674 --> 00:13:16,674
What do you think if you finally pay attention?

227
00:13:16,674 --> 00:13:18,674
I did pay attention!

228
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:19,674
That's right!

229
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:20,674
Don't lie again!

230
00:13:22,674 --> 00:13:23,674
All right.

231
00:13:25,674 --> 00:13:28,674
Then the goose said to the fox, too stupid.

232
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:30,674
We'll hear that tomorrow.

233
00:13:30,674 --> 00:13:31,674
Well, finally!

234
00:13:31,674 --> 00:13:32,336
Pack your things!

235
00:13:32,336 --> 00:13:37,336
Pack your things! Let's go! Only today afternoon, then it's over!

236
00:13:37,336 --> 00:13:38,922
Peter? Yes, what?

237
00:13:38,922 --> 00:13:41,922
Is it true that you're participating in the race this time?

238
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:42,922
How do you know that?

239
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,922
They say that the Almöhi builds the Alps.

240
00:13:44,922 --> 00:13:45,922
Aha, that's how they say it.

241
00:13:45,922 --> 00:13:48,922
That will definitely be a good one. The Almöhi understands something about it.

242
00:13:48,922 --> 00:13:50,922
He does that only because Heidi likes you.

243
00:13:50,922 --> 00:13:53,922
If you want to know exactly, he doesn't do anything. I do it.

244
00:13:53,922 --> 00:13:56,922
Yes, and you don't even believe how well he does it.

245
00:13:56,922 --> 00:13:59,922
We really don't believe that. Don't give him any questions.

246
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:00,640
What?

247
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,840
Who's betting here?

248
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,240
Well, you. Who else?

249
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,840
Making a sled is not that easy.

250
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,340
Why?

251
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,140
Peter can never do that in his life.

252
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,340
I'll bet with you if you want.

253
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,640
Peter has two left thumbs.

254
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,640
Everyone knows that.

255
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,440
Then everyone knows that you have two stupid heads.

256
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,040
You're pretty cheeky.

257
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,940
Heidi, come on, we don't have time for that.

258
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,640
Aha, first lie and then believe it.

259
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,140
So good, if you don't want to believe it,

260
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,140
then come to us and ask my grandfather

261
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,340
who makes the sled.

262
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,140
Ask Almy?

263
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,140
Al...

264
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:27,232
You're too shy to do that. That's fine.

265
00:14:27,232 --> 00:14:30,232
Shy? I've heard that before. Come on, let's go.

266
00:14:30,232 --> 00:14:33,232
Actually, I have to go home. I shouldn't be late for dinner.

267
00:14:36,232 --> 00:14:38,232
Grandfather, we're back!

268
00:14:38,232 --> 00:14:40,232
Is school already over?

269
00:14:40,232 --> 00:14:45,232
I've got a few schoolmates with me. They really want to ask you something they
don't want to believe.

270
00:14:46,232 --> 00:14:48,864
Well, what are you still waiting for?

271
00:14:48,864 --> 00:14:49,864
What's going on?

272
00:14:49,864 --> 00:14:51,864
We... we know it's...

273
00:14:51,864 --> 00:14:53,864
Because... because we said...

274
00:14:53,864 --> 00:14:54,864
Exactly because of that, yes.

275
00:14:54,864 --> 00:14:56,864
Are you all hearing badly or stuttering?

276
00:14:56,864 --> 00:14:58,864
The food is getting cold.

277
00:14:58,864 --> 00:14:59,864
Goodbye.

278
00:15:01,864 --> 00:15:03,864
You have to explain that to me now.

279
00:15:03,864 --> 00:15:04,864
Gladly.

280
00:15:04,864 --> 00:15:08,864
They just didn't want to believe me earlier that Peter was making the sled and
not you.

281
00:15:08,864 --> 00:15:10,864
Then I told them they shouldn't ask themselves.

282
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,940
But why did they all run away all of a sudden?

283
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:17,140
Who knows? Sometimes you children behave so strangely.

284
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,940
But your sled is waiting for you.

285
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,940
Good!

286
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:25,940
This here?

287
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,940
Yes! Hooray! Hooray!

288
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,940
Come on in quickly! He's gone!

289
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:31,078
It's done.

290
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:32,078
Show me.

291
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:36,078
Very good, Peter, excellent.

292
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:41,078
So?

293
00:15:41,078 --> 00:15:42,078
Isn't it good enough?

294
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:44,078
Oh yes, it's very good.

295
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:47,078
I just want to improve it a little bit.

296
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:48,078
No, leave it.

297
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:52,078
It should look exactly like everyone else thinks Peter made it.

298
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:54,078
As you wish.

299
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,078
Thank you.

300
00:15:55,078 --> 00:15:57,078
Come on, let's go out and try it on, okay?

301
00:15:57,078 --> 00:15:58,078
Oh yes.

302
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:01,078
Let's go.

306
00:16:42,526 --> 00:16:44,526
All of a sudden, he went to the side all by himself.

307
00:16:44,526 --> 00:16:45,526
Like this?

308
00:16:48,526 --> 00:16:50,526
I don't think I did that right.

309
00:16:50,526 --> 00:16:51,526
Like this.

310
00:16:58,526 --> 00:17:02,526
And if you can't do it now, what do we do then, huh?

311
00:17:02,526 --> 00:17:05,526
Just don't be afraid. I can do it. Easy.

312
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:06,526
Hopefully.

313
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:07,526
I'd rather help you.

314
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,526
It doesn't matter.

315
00:17:09,526 --> 00:17:12,526
Really, Heidi, it's easy. Believe me.

316
00:17:12,526 --> 00:17:15,526
How do you want to know? You don't even know what's wrong.

317
00:17:15,526 --> 00:17:18,526
One side is higher than the other.

318
00:17:18,526 --> 00:17:20,526
I don't know.

319
00:17:27,526 --> 00:17:29,526
I need to pee!

320
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:32,110
How was the first ride with the sled?

321
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,110
Short.

322
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:41,110
Isn't he fast enough?

323
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:44,110
If only. He doesn't even ride straight.

324
00:17:58,674 --> 00:18:23,674
Let's go.

325
00:18:23,954 --> 00:18:28,954
Well, don't look so disappointed. Peter will get it right, for sure.

326
00:18:28,954 --> 00:18:31,954
I don't know. He's going to take it all off again.

327
00:18:31,954 --> 00:18:33,954
No, it's going to be right.

328
00:18:33,954 --> 00:18:36,954
Peter! Grandfather thinks it's going to be something.

330
00:19:13,618 --> 00:19:16,618
Hopefully, everything will be fine.

331
00:19:16,618 --> 00:19:19,618
And if he falls apart now?

332
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,630
Here we go!

333
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:26,630
Here we go!

334
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:28,630
Here we go!

335
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:29,630
Come on!

336
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,630
Here we go!

337
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,630
Here we go!

338
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:22,630
Here we go!

339
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,630
Peter, we're going to catch him!

340
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:30,630
Here we go!

341
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:36,630
Here we go!

342
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,630
I'm finally going to catch him!

343
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,630
Peter! Peter! Peter!

344
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:52,630
Peter! Peter!

345
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:58,630
Here we go!

346
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,630
Here we go!

347
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,630
No! No! No!

348
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:18,630
Peter?

349
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:22,630
Peter!

350
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:23,630
Peter!

351
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:24,630
Peter!

Peter!

Peter!

Peter!

367
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,630
Peter!

368
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:41,630
Peter!

369
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:42,630
Peter!

370
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:43,630
Peter!

371
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:44,630
Peter!

372
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,630
Peter!

373
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,630
Peter!

374
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:47,630
Peter!

375
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:48,630
Peter!

376
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:49,630
Peter!

377
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:50,630
Peter!

378
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,630
We arrived at the bottom.

379
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,630
Congratulations, Peter.

380
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:55,526
That went quite well.

381
00:21:55,526 --> 00:21:58,526
Isn't it nice that you made the cut all by yourself?

382
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:01,526
Unfortunately there was another one who came exactly with him.

383
00:22:01,526 --> 00:22:02,526
So two wins.

384
00:22:02,526 --> 00:22:05,526
Nevertheless, it is a good result that you can be proud of.

385
00:22:05,526 --> 00:22:06,526
Are you happy?

386
00:22:06,526 --> 00:22:08,526
Yes, I would love to burst.

387
00:22:09,526 --> 00:22:11,526
Well, let's hope that you don't do that.

388
00:22:11,526 --> 00:22:13,526
You will be a good carpenter.

389
00:22:13,526 --> 00:22:14,526
Could be.

390
00:22:15,526 --> 00:22:16,526
Could be!

391
00:22:17,526 --> 00:22:18,526
I would like to!

392
00:22:18,526 --> 00:22:20,526
Then let's go to my grandfather.

393
00:22:20,646 --> 00:22:24,646
Good, I'll bring it to you, but only after school.

394
00:22:24,646 --> 00:22:26,646
Not instead.

395
00:22:26,646 --> 00:22:28,646
That could be good for you.

396
00:22:28,646 --> 00:22:30,646
Now run and tell Grandmother that you've won.

397
00:22:30,646 --> 00:22:32,646
And greetings.

398
00:22:32,646 --> 00:22:35,646
Goodbye and thank you very, very much, Grandfather.

399
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:37,646
Did you say Grandfather?

400
00:22:37,646 --> 00:22:39,646
Yes, of course.

401
00:22:49,478 --> 00:22:56,478
The winter went by and Heidi discovered together with Joseph the first precincts
of spring.

402
00:22:56,478 --> 00:23:03,478
Every single flower was greeted by her with joy and soon the Almöhi and she
could pull up to the hut again.

403
00:23:03,478 --> 00:23:10,478
It was still cold and there was high snow, but up here Heidi still felt the most
comfortable.

404
00:23:13,478 --> 00:23:17,478
And then for the first time in a long time a letter from Clara from Frankfurt
came again.

405
00:23:17,836 --> 00:23:27,836
In which she wrote that she would not wish for anything more beautiful than to
be able to visit Heidi and Peter, but we want to tell you about that in our next
story.

406
00:23:28,434 --> 00:23:57,434
Heidi, Heidi, your world are the mountains. Heidi, Heidi, because up here you
are at home. Heidi, Heidi, come home, find your happiness, come back home.

407
00:23:58,434 --> 00:23:59,392
Thank you for watching.
