Run!

20
00:01:36,786 --> 00:01:37,786
Mother!

21
00:01:37,786 --> 00:01:38,786
Yes?

22
00:01:39,786 --> 00:01:41,786
Have you already let the goat out?

23
00:01:41,786 --> 00:01:43,786
You know that I want to take her away today.

24
00:01:43,786 --> 00:01:44,786
Why are you doing this?

25
00:01:44,786 --> 00:01:45,786
I can tell you that.

26
00:01:47,786 --> 00:01:50,786
Yesterday evening she gave some milk for the first time.

27
00:01:50,786 --> 00:01:51,786
I will keep her.

28
00:01:51,786 --> 00:01:53,786
I do not believe that this has anything to say.

29
00:01:53,786 --> 00:01:55,786
This is very likely pure coincidence.

30
00:01:55,786 --> 00:01:56,786
She will come away tomorrow.

31
00:01:57,786 --> 00:01:58,786
Does not come into question.

32
00:02:00,176 --> 00:02:03,176
- How is she? - Better every day.

33
00:02:03,176 --> 00:02:07,176
- Has she started giving milk? - Yes, for the first time last night.

34
00:02:07,176 --> 00:02:11,176
- It's not that easy with her, is it? - Yes, you could say that.

35
00:02:11,176 --> 00:02:13,176
There she is.

36
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:18,176
Come on, you'll come every day later.

37
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:24,826
Don't be so slow! We want...

38
00:02:24,826 --> 00:02:26,826
Peter!

39
00:02:26,826 --> 00:02:27,826
Yes?

40
00:02:27,826 --> 00:02:29,826
Be so kind and wait.

41
00:02:29,826 --> 00:02:31,826
What is it?

42
00:02:31,826 --> 00:02:33,826
Unfortunately I don't have any good news.

43
00:02:33,826 --> 00:02:36,826
He wants to bring Snooki to town tomorrow and sell her.

44
00:02:36,826 --> 00:02:37,826
No!

45
00:02:37,826 --> 00:02:40,826
Yes, I tried to talk to him but it didn't make any sense.

46
00:02:54,826 --> 00:02:56,506
To be continued...

47
00:02:56,506 --> 00:03:00,506
Dumb, all together they are so dumb that I would have to hurt them.

48
00:03:00,506 --> 00:03:02,506
And you don't even know what it's all about.

49
00:03:04,506 --> 00:03:07,506
One works from morning to evening.

50
00:03:07,506 --> 00:03:09,506
Schnucki was to be sold.

51
00:03:09,506 --> 00:03:13,506
All the efforts, worries and dangers of the last few days were for nothing.

52
00:03:13,506 --> 00:03:17,506
That morning Peter had to get up to everything, very, very hard.

53
00:03:18,662 --> 00:03:21,662
That should even be enough for Peter's hunger.

54
00:03:21,662 --> 00:03:23,662
We want to climb up even further today.

55
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:27,662
There will certainly be much better herbs growing up there than down here with
us.

56
00:03:27,662 --> 00:03:30,662
But be careful. It's going to be very windy now.

57
00:03:30,662 --> 00:03:33,662
Yes, yes, certainly. We are always careful.

58
00:03:33,662 --> 00:03:36,662
Do you promise me that you will call Peter today?

59
00:03:36,662 --> 00:03:39,662
If he says it will be too dangerous, then that's true.

60
00:03:39,662 --> 00:03:41,662
Do you actually listen to him?

61
00:03:41,662 --> 00:03:44,662
But yes, of course. I understood everything. I have to go now.

62
00:03:44,662 --> 00:03:48,662
Goodbye. See you tonight. Good morning, Peter.

63
00:03:51,662 --> 00:03:54,662
Which goat is coming into my arms?

64
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:58,102
Have you already given milk, Schnucki?

65
00:03:58,102 --> 00:04:00,102
Peter!

66
00:04:00,102 --> 00:04:02,102
Good morning, Heidi.

67
00:04:02,102 --> 00:04:04,102
Good morning, Peter!

68
00:04:04,102 --> 00:04:06,102
Oh, yes.

69
00:04:06,102 --> 00:04:08,102
Have you already taken it?

70
00:04:08,102 --> 00:04:10,102
Let's see.

71
00:04:14,502 --> 00:04:19,702
- What's going on? - I can barely lift her, she's much heavier than yesterday.

72
00:04:19,902 --> 00:04:23,702
- Peter, good morning. - Did you see that?

73
00:04:23,902 --> 00:04:28,102
Heidi said he wanted to go higher today, I don't like that at all.

74
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:32,702
Me neither, but we're not going anywhere today anyway.

75
00:04:32,902 --> 00:04:36,502
- What does that mean? - Do you know a better place down there?

76
00:04:36,604 --> 00:04:41,404
No, I don't know a better place down there, and if I did, we wouldn't need it at
all.

77
00:04:41,604 --> 00:04:45,604
What do you mean? Are you afraid of that little wind?

78
00:04:45,804 --> 00:04:49,004
It doesn't make any sense. They want to sell Snuggie tomorrow.

79
00:04:49,204 --> 00:04:50,604
No!

80
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,730
They want to sell Snuggie tomorrow.

81
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,982
They want to sell Snuggie tomorrow.

82
00:05:22,982 --> 00:05:25,982
Show me that you're a good goat-hunter.

83
00:05:25,982 --> 00:05:28,982
A goat loves all its goats, not just one.

84
00:05:28,982 --> 00:05:30,982
Come with me.

85
00:05:30,982 --> 00:05:31,982
Leave me alone.

86
00:05:31,982 --> 00:05:33,982
It won't help.

87
00:05:33,982 --> 00:05:34,982
Come on.

88
00:05:34,982 --> 00:05:36,982
Leave me alone. I don't want to.

89
00:05:36,982 --> 00:05:38,982
Stop crying. It won't help.

00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:06,770
Didn't you notice that she's already grown up?

92
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:07,770
Stop!

93
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:08,770
What is it?

94
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,770
No, no, no, I'm not going any further!

95
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,770
Come on, we're going further!

96
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,770
We can't do anything!

97
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:24,210
I just can't understand. Schnucki has gotten much bigger.

98
00:06:32,914 --> 00:06:36,114
Lady, calm down. I can't do anything about it.

99
00:06:36,314 --> 00:06:39,714
If I was rich, I'd buy a doll for us, but I don't have any money.

100
00:06:39,914 --> 00:06:40,914
What am I supposed to do?

101
00:06:41,114 --> 00:06:45,114
Stop this constant crying. It won't help us any more.

102
00:06:45,314 --> 00:06:48,514
But it helps me. When I cry, I can think better.

103
00:06:48,714 --> 00:06:50,714
Maybe I'll remember something.

104
00:06:52,914 --> 00:06:56,114
I really don't know what else could come to mind.

105
00:07:00,946 --> 00:07:05,946
Come on, Heidi, let's go on. We can't do anything for a moment.

106
00:07:05,946 --> 00:07:09,946
I won't go on. I'll stay here until I think of something.

107
00:07:10,846 --> 00:07:12,846
I'll stay here until I think of something.

108
00:07:40,846 --> 00:07:42,846
No. No, it's up to me.

109
00:07:42,846 --> 00:07:43,846
Something just happened.

110
00:07:43,846 --> 00:07:44,846
Something just happened.

111
00:07:44,846 --> 00:07:45,846
Hurray.

112
00:07:46,846 --> 00:07:47,846
Don't die.

113
00:07:47,846 --> 00:07:48,846
I'll jump higher than you.

114
00:07:48,846 --> 00:07:49,846
Look out.

115
00:07:49,846 --> 00:07:50,846
There!

116
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:51,846
I'll jump in circles and around.

117
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,846
And round and around and around and around and around.

118
00:07:54,846 --> 00:07:55,846
One and two.

119
00:07:55,846 --> 00:07:56,846
One and two.

120
00:07:56,846 --> 00:07:57,846
One and two.

121
00:07:57,846 --> 00:07:58,846
One and two.

122
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:00,346
You insisted on catching it.

123
00:08:01,846 --> 00:08:02,846
Watch out.

124
00:08:03,846 --> 00:08:05,846
It's coming into my arms.

125
00:08:06,846 --> 00:08:07,846
Watch out.

126
00:08:08,846 --> 00:08:09,846
Ouch.

127
00:08:10,846 --> 00:08:12,846
Ouch, ouch! - You can't get in there!

128
00:08:12,846 --> 00:08:14,846
Don't bother! I'm faster!

129
00:08:14,846 --> 00:08:16,846
Now you'll have to run after me again!

130
00:08:18,846 --> 00:08:20,846
They'll make eye contact!

131
00:08:20,846 --> 00:08:22,846
They'll be stunned! What do you think, Peter?

132
00:08:22,846 --> 00:08:24,846
We'll show them!

133
00:08:28,846 --> 00:08:30,846
Say something!

134
00:08:30,846 --> 00:08:32,846
Put your hands on me!

135
00:08:34,846 --> 00:08:36,846
Look at the two of them!

136
00:08:40,846 --> 00:08:54,846
And if it doesn't work out...

137
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,030
You haven't eaten a piece yet.

138
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,830
Say something at least.

139
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:26,630
I don't know what to say. And I'm not hungry.

Yes, what is it?

145
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,958
What if he forbids us? Maybe he doesn't want them.

146
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,958
Where do we want to bring them then? I'm scared.

147
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,958
Yes? Do you think he'll do that? I don't think so.

148
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,958
Joseph, be quiet today. There won't be a single call.

149
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,958
And you're not allowed to complain.

150
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,958
You're not going to keep it a secret, are you?

151
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,958
Yes, why not? Maybe you'll notice something better?

152
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,958
We have to win some time, don't we?

153
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:11,958
Yes, but...

154
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,958
Don't make such a face. I don't want to steal them at all.

155
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,958
I'll just borrow them.

156
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,958
Come, Snooki.

157
00:11:19,422 --> 00:11:21,422
That can't be good.

158
00:11:21,422 --> 00:11:22,422
Hey, wait for me!

159
00:11:22,422 --> 00:11:24,422
You can't do that in secret!

160
00:11:24,422 --> 00:11:26,422
We need the help of everyone!

161
00:11:26,422 --> 00:11:29,422
And what should we do if he forbids it, you fool?

162
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:32,422
When it comes out, you'll owe me everything.

163
00:11:32,422 --> 00:11:34,422
Well, then you'll owe me everything.

164
00:11:34,422 --> 00:11:36,422
It's still better than selling Snuggie.

165
00:11:36,422 --> 00:11:40,422
You could at least think for a second what will come out of me!

166
00:11:40,422 --> 00:11:42,422
You were agreeable with that.

167
00:11:42,422 --> 00:11:45,422
I don't understand why you're acting like that all of a sudden.

168
00:11:45,422 --> 00:11:49,422
Oh, she's got a fat head.

00:12:51,362 --> 00:12:53,362
Heidi, will you tell me something?

182
00:12:53,362 --> 00:12:55,362
It won't be a big deal.

183
00:12:55,362 --> 00:12:57,362
Where do you want to go? What's the matter?

184
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,362
Schwendi and Berli ate a lot today.

185
00:13:01,362 --> 00:13:04,362
That makes me happy. They'll give him a lot of milk tonight.

186
00:13:04,362 --> 00:13:07,362
I'll give him something else. It'll do him good.

187
00:13:07,362 --> 00:13:09,362
Schwendi, Berli, come here.

188
00:13:14,362 --> 00:13:16,362
I'll give you something else.

189
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:18,362
I'll give you something else.

190
00:13:18,362 --> 00:13:20,362
I'll give you something else.

191
00:13:23,362 --> 00:13:25,362
Snooki?

192
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:34,090
You don't want to tell me, do you? You've lost Schnucki on the way.

193
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:37,090
Do you expect me to believe that? Answer me!

194
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:42,090
Have you lost your tongue or have you been frightened by your own lies?

195
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:48,090
Get in motion and bring Schnucki back here, or do I have to break your legs
first, my son?

196
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:49,090
No!

197
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,090
Very well, then get out with your tongue.

198
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:54,090
Where did you leave the goat? Did you hide it?

199
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,090
No.

200
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,090
She's at the almery.

201
00:13:58,506 --> 00:14:02,506
Heidi kept her upstairs. She wants to feed her some more.

202
00:14:02,506 --> 00:14:05,506
- It's my goat! - Everybody knows that.

203
00:14:05,506 --> 00:14:07,506
You don't, apparently.

204
00:14:07,506 --> 00:14:10,506
Otherwise you would have brought her back with you.

205
00:14:28,506 --> 00:14:31,146

206
00:14:31,146 --> 00:14:36,146
Heidi, I hope you know that we can't keep Schnucki.

207
00:14:37,146 --> 00:14:39,146
Keep quiet.

208
00:14:42,146 --> 00:14:44,146
Stay here.

209
00:14:50,986 --> 00:14:53,986
Now let's see if we can do that, too.

210
00:14:55,986 --> 00:14:56,986
Like this.

211
00:15:02,294 --> 00:15:05,294
Can you hear me, Snooki? It's working.

212
00:15:13,294 --> 00:15:16,294
When you're done, please come in.

213
00:15:26,518 --> 00:15:29,518
Look, Snooki, you can be proud.

214
00:15:37,174 --> 00:15:39,174
Very good.

215
00:15:39,174 --> 00:15:41,174
Grandfather! Grandfather!

216
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:44,174
Would you like to try a sip of this milk?

217
00:15:46,174 --> 00:15:48,174
Tell me, Maria.

218
00:15:51,174 --> 00:15:53,174
A big sip, yes?

219
00:16:03,798 --> 00:16:07,798
Very, very good. The milk tastes excellent, really.

220
00:16:08,798 --> 00:16:10,798
As good as any other goat's milk?

221
00:16:12,798 --> 00:16:14,798
Hooray! We did it! We did it!

222
00:16:14,798 --> 00:16:15,798
Snuggie gives milk!

223
00:16:15,798 --> 00:16:18,798
Really wonderful goat's milk that tastes good!

224
00:16:20,194 --> 00:16:25,194
Good morning, Peter! Hurry up! I have to tell you something!

225
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:29,194
I have a surprise for you!

226
00:16:29,194 --> 00:16:31,194
What is it?

227
00:16:31,194 --> 00:16:33,194
I have a surprise for you!

228
00:16:33,194 --> 00:16:35,194
What is it?

229
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:37,194
What is it?

230
00:16:37,194 --> 00:16:39,194
What is it?

231
00:16:39,194 --> 00:16:41,194
What is it?

232
00:16:41,194 --> 00:16:43,194
What is it?

233
00:16:43,194 --> 00:16:45,194
What is it?

234
00:16:45,194 --> 00:16:47,194
What is it?

235
00:16:47,194 --> 00:16:49,194
What is it?

236
00:16:49,194 --> 00:16:51,194
I have a surprise for you!

237
00:16:55,194 --> 00:16:57,194
Is someone coming with Peter?

238
00:16:58,006 --> 00:17:01,006
Leave the talking to me. I know how to deal with him.

239
00:17:01,006 --> 00:17:04,006
Nurmut, do you still think what you did was right?

240
00:17:04,006 --> 00:17:05,006
Really?

241
00:17:06,006 --> 00:17:09,006
I'd rather disappear for a moment.

242
00:17:25,006 --> 00:17:26,006
There.

243
00:17:27,382 --> 00:17:29,382
I want to know what you did to my goat.

244
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,382
I know you're here.

245
00:17:31,382 --> 00:17:33,382
Or should I knock on the door?

246
00:17:33,382 --> 00:17:35,382
You thief!

247
00:17:35,382 --> 00:17:37,382
Why aren't you saying anything?

248
00:17:37,382 --> 00:17:39,382
He was talking in the hut.

249
00:17:39,382 --> 00:17:41,382
Come in.

250
00:17:41,382 --> 00:17:43,382
You don't let anyone else in your hut.

251
00:17:43,382 --> 00:17:45,382
What's the point?

252
00:17:45,382 --> 00:17:47,382
I want to talk to you.

253
00:17:47,382 --> 00:17:49,382
Why?

254
00:17:51,382 --> 00:17:53,382
Well.

255
00:17:56,834 --> 00:18:00,834
Schnucki is with me, and she's very well taken care of.

256
00:18:00,834 --> 00:18:04,834
Very well taken care of? And you promise to protect her!

257
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,834
What do you want? What's that supposed to be?

258
00:18:07,834 --> 00:18:08,834
Here, drink.

259
00:18:08,834 --> 00:18:10,834
Who knows what that thing is?

260
00:18:10,834 --> 00:18:13,834
That's just goat's milk. Try it.

261
00:18:15,834 --> 00:18:18,834
Goat's milk? I know how goat's milk tastes.

262
00:18:18,834 --> 00:18:26,504
How do you like the milk? Does it taste worse than other goat's milk?

263
00:18:26,504 --> 00:18:30,104
No, not at all. You can be proud of your goat.

264
00:18:30,304 --> 00:18:31,704
I have nothing to do with it.

265
00:18:31,904 --> 00:18:34,704
If someone here has the right to be proud, then you have it.

266
00:18:34,904 --> 00:18:36,704
The milk is from your own goat,

267
00:18:36,904 --> 00:18:39,704
from the goat you want to sell to the butcher.

268
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:42,504
And the kids wanted to prove that to you.

269
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:45,104
That's why Snooki hid here with me.

270
00:18:46,104 --> 00:18:49,704
But fools can't see what they have on such a goat.

271
00:18:49,904 --> 00:18:51,504
Don't call me that!

272
00:18:51,704 --> 00:18:53,904
You think you're particularly smart.

273
00:18:54,104 --> 00:18:56,304
If someone here is a fool, then you are!

275
00:18:56,744 --> 00:19:01,504
What do you think you're doing? You don't expect me to believe that this girl is
Snuggie's!

276
00:19:01,504 --> 00:19:06,104
I just figured out that I could talk to you like to a reasonable person.

277
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:09,744
What? Don't put your nose in my business!

278
00:19:09,744 --> 00:19:16,104
It's all my fault! Grandfather can't do anything about it! He didn't even want
to!

279
00:19:16,104 --> 00:19:22,304
I hid Snuggie from them because I didn't want them to sell her to the butcher.
That's all!

280
00:19:22,304 --> 00:19:24,304
What are you saying?

281
00:19:26,744 --> 00:19:27,810
It's all my fault!

282
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:32,810
All summer long we've been looking for fresh herbs for her to give her good
milk.

283
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:35,810
And she gives good milk and she's grown up.

284
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:39,810
But Schnucki is my goat. She belongs to me. Who told you to do that?

285
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:45,810
Nobody told us. Peter and I did it on our own because we both love Schnucki
very, very much.

286
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:49,810
She's the most beautiful goat in the world. And she's also my girlfriend.

287
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,496
Huh? Girlfriend?

288
00:19:51,496 --> 00:19:55,496
Yes, she's my girlfriend, and I'd really like to show her how to give milk.

289
00:19:55,496 --> 00:19:57,496
There's no one who gives such good milk.

290
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:00,496
How am I supposed to show it to you if you don't come with me?

291
00:20:09,282 --> 00:20:11,282
No, I don't want to believe that.

292
00:20:11,282 --> 00:20:12,482
You can see it.

293
00:20:12,482 --> 00:20:14,482
Yes, but I don't believe what I see.

294
00:20:17,882 --> 00:20:20,482
Here. Please, try the milk.

295
00:20:21,082 --> 00:20:22,682
Not much, but very good.

296
00:20:23,282 --> 00:20:25,682
Why don't you drink? Is there something with the milk?

297
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,682
Huh? No.

298
00:20:27,682 --> 00:20:29,682
Here.

299
00:20:38,082 --> 00:20:38,978
Good.

300
00:20:38,978 --> 00:20:42,978
- What did I say? Not much, but very good. - Yes.

301
00:20:43,978 --> 00:20:46,978
Peter, why didn't you tell me about it down in the village?

302
00:20:46,978 --> 00:20:49,978
I asked you often enough what's going on with the goat.

303
00:20:49,978 --> 00:20:53,978
It didn't work. Every time I wanted to tell you, you yelled at me.

304
00:20:53,978 --> 00:20:56,978
- I wanted to. - But you never let me say anything!

305
00:20:56,978 --> 00:21:00,978
Please, please, please don't sell it, Schnucki. It's so lovely and so small.

306
00:21:01,978 --> 00:21:04,978
Please, please don't. We'll give it a lot of trouble.

307
00:21:04,978 --> 00:21:08,978
It grows and becomes huge and gives more milk than all other goats.

308
00:21:10,414 --> 00:21:15,414
Hm, I don't know. What can you say about that? You seem to really like these
goats.

309
00:21:15,414 --> 00:21:18,414
Why don't you just say yes?

310
00:21:18,414 --> 00:21:22,414
Yes, very well. You should show what you can do.

311
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:25,414
I'll give you one year to make a real goat out of Schnucki.

312
00:21:25,414 --> 00:21:28,414
Yes, hurray! Thank you!

313
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,414
Well, I congratulate you.

314
00:21:32,414 --> 00:21:34,414
Peter, Schnucki, we have to celebrate that. Come on, quickly!

315
00:21:34,414 --> 00:21:36,414
Yes, I'm coming!

316
00:21:37,414 --> 00:21:39,414
Come on, Joseph!

317
00:21:40,414 --> 00:21:42,414
Come on!

318
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,214
At the end he was as soft as butter

319
00:22:04,214 --> 00:22:09,414
It is understandable that Heidi and Peter didn't know what to do anymore

320
00:22:09,414 --> 00:22:12,734
They jumped and ran and roamed all day

321
00:22:12,734 --> 00:22:17,694
And even Joseph, who likes to sleep so much, couldn't sit still

322
00:22:18,934 --> 00:22:22,294
They had a whole year to take care of Schnucki and take care of him

323
00:22:22,294 --> 00:22:25,814
And without them having to say it, they both decided...

324
00:22:25,828 --> 00:22:30,328
...to look for all the herbs that were necessary to turn Snooki into a good
milking goat.

325
00:22:30,328 --> 00:22:35,328
And if they had to climb even higher, even further, they wanted to do
everything.

326
00:22:44,942 --> 00:22:48,942
The summer ended quickly. The first snow fell.

327
00:22:48,942 --> 00:22:52,942
And for Heidi the long waiting time for sun and heavy snow began again.

328
00:22:52,942 --> 00:22:58,942
Every morning she was happy that Peter picked her up with the sled and brought
her down into the valley.

329
00:23:03,534 --> 00:23:08,534
She liked to drive down, because down in the village she could meet old
acquaintances.

330
00:23:08,534 --> 00:23:14,534
There were many surprises for her, sometimes good, sometimes less good.

331
00:23:14,534 --> 00:23:17,534
In the village it was never boring for Heidi.

332
00:23:17,534 --> 00:23:21,534
But we want to tell you about that in our next story.

333
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:50,010
"Heidi, Heidi, your world are the mountains. Heidi, Heidi, because up here you
are at home. Heidi, Heidi, come home, find your happiness, come back home."

334
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,184
Thanks for watching!
