1
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,490
Well, what are you doing so early on your legs, my child?

2
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,490
I'm waiting for my aunt.

3
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,490
For your aunt Dete?

4
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,490
Good morning, Thomas. How are you?

5
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,490
I'm very well, but what's going on with you?

6
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,490
Nothing special. I want to fly with Heidi to the village.

7
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,490
I could take you to Mayenfeld.

8
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,490
Oh, thank you, Thomas. That's nice of you.

9
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:47,490
Well, let's go, you two.

10
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:51,490
Immediately. Here, Heidi, tie your scarf so you don't lose it.

11
00:02:52,602 --> 00:02:55,602
- I'm hot. - You'd rather sweat than wear it.

12
00:02:55,602 --> 00:02:57,602
Hold on tight.

13
00:02:58,602 --> 00:03:01,602
Come on, Lottie, we have to go.

14
00:03:13,845 --> 00:03:18,845
So, so, so, there you two pretty girls want to fly to the village in the early
morning.

15
00:03:18,845 --> 00:03:21,845
Is there a church today or some kind of child baptism?

16
00:03:21,845 --> 00:03:23,845
No, I'm bringing Heidi up to the Alme Öhi.

17
00:03:23,845 --> 00:03:24,845
What is she supposed to do there?

18
00:03:24,845 --> 00:03:25,845
She's supposed to stay there.

19
00:03:25,845 --> 00:03:27,845
I found a position in Frankfurt.

20
00:03:27,845 --> 00:03:29,845
Unfortunately, I can't use it.

21
00:03:29,845 --> 00:03:31,845
Done.

22
00:03:40,341 --> 00:03:45,341
There she goes, little Heidi, and doesn't even know what's going to happen to
her.

23
00:03:45,341 --> 00:03:48,341
After the death of her parents, she lived with her aunt Dete.

24
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:52,341
And Heidi always thought that aunt Dete would be her only relative.

25
00:03:52,341 --> 00:03:56,341
But suddenly everyone was talking about an old Moorish moor.

26
00:03:56,341 --> 00:03:59,341
And this moor should be her grandfather.

27
00:03:59,341 --> 00:04:04,341
And every time Heidi asked how he looked, no one could give her an answer.

28
00:04:04,341 --> 00:04:07,341
For years, no one had seen this grandfather again.

29
00:05:13,109 --> 00:05:15,109
I'm sorry, I have to sit you down here.

30
00:05:15,109 --> 00:05:17,109
Thank you, Thomas, that has already helped.

31
00:05:19,109 --> 00:05:22,109
Heidi, what are you doing again now?

32
00:05:22,109 --> 00:05:25,109
Try it too, it's nice and cold.

33
00:05:25,109 --> 00:05:27,109
Goodbye, take care.

34
00:05:33,141 --> 00:05:36,141
How is that supposed to be with those old men?

35
00:05:37,141 --> 00:05:39,141
Here!

36
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:02,568
Can't you run a little faster?

37
00:06:05,568 --> 00:06:09,568
Heidi, where are you staying? Don't move!

38
00:06:11,568 --> 00:06:14,568
The mountain is too steep. I'm warm.

39
00:06:16,568 --> 00:06:21,568
Heidi, if we don't hurry, we'll never get to the top. Come on!

40
00:06:44,016 --> 00:06:46,016
What's going on? Are you tired?

41
00:06:46,016 --> 00:06:50,016
How far is it? It's so warm here. I can't take it anymore.

42
00:06:50,016 --> 00:06:54,016
It's over there. Look, Heidi. That's Dörfli. That's where you were born.

43
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:59,996
That's where I was born?

44
00:07:05,584 --> 00:07:10,284
That's the bell of the village church. Come on, Heidi, let's go.

45
00:07:18,256 --> 00:07:21,256
Well, that's something, isn't it, Dede? Hello.

46
00:07:21,256 --> 00:07:22,256
Good morning.

47
00:07:22,256 --> 00:07:23,256
Come on in for a moment.

48
00:07:23,256 --> 00:07:25,256
Another time, we're in a hurry.

49
00:07:27,256 --> 00:07:29,256
Dede, well, something like that.

50
00:07:29,256 --> 00:07:30,256
Good morning.

51
00:07:30,256 --> 00:07:32,256
I haven't seen you in a long time.

52
00:07:32,256 --> 00:07:34,256
People say you're working now.

53
00:07:34,256 --> 00:07:35,256
I'm even going to Frankfurt.

54
00:07:35,256 --> 00:07:39,256
What? And now just say the sweet little one, there's your child.

55
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:41,526
I don't have a child yet, that's Heidi.

56
00:07:41,526 --> 00:07:43,526
Heidi? What kind of Heidi?

57
00:07:43,526 --> 00:07:46,526
The daughter of Adelheid, my older sister.

58
00:07:46,526 --> 00:07:47,526
You know that.

59
00:07:47,526 --> 00:07:49,526
Well, isn't that...

60
00:07:49,526 --> 00:07:50,526
Of course it is.

61
00:07:50,526 --> 00:07:53,526
She told the little one, there's the child of Adelheid.

62
00:07:53,526 --> 00:07:57,526
If that's the case, then you have to be the little Heidi. I've heard a lot about
you.

63
00:07:57,526 --> 00:08:00,526
What do you two want here in the village?

64
00:08:00,526 --> 00:08:03,462
We're on our way to the Almyrhy. I'll take Heidi to him.

65
00:08:03,462 --> 00:08:08,462
- What about the old one? - But don't you want to leave the little one alone
with the old one?

66
00:08:08,462 --> 00:08:13,462
I have nothing else to do. I found a job in Frankfurt and now the grandfather
has to take care of her.

67
00:08:13,462 --> 00:08:16,462
What? You're giving him the child?

68
00:08:18,462 --> 00:08:22,462
- I'm already sorry for the little one. - That can't be serious, Dete.

69
00:08:22,462 --> 00:08:24,462
Oh yes.

70
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:28,462
For years the old one hasn't been allowed to look at us in the village.

71
00:08:28,462 --> 00:08:31,190
He doesn't even come to church on Sunday.

72
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:35,690
If only I knew what the old one is up to, that he's up there alone on the
almshouse.

73
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,690
- You know what? - Dieter!

74
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,190
- Dieter, stay here! - Goodbye!

75
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:43,190
But you're not talking to any more people.

76
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,190
And he has such terribly bushy eyebrows.

77
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,190
- You must be totally crazy. - I don't care what you think of me.

78
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,190
He's your grandfather and he's on it now.

79
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:58,180
But no one knows what he's doing.

80
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:03,180
He can be seen at least once a year and even then he doesn't say a word to any
of us.

81
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,180
Something's not right up there.

82
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:11,180
No man keeps his whole life, mother soul alone, somewhere in the mountains on an
alp.

83
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:04,779
What kind of a terrible child is that? Completely uneducated.

84
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:08,779
He just ran over you. Did you hurt yourself, Heidi?

85
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:10,779
Come on, come here.

86
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:12,471
Kiss.

87
00:10:16,203 --> 00:10:22,203
I can understand you, Deete, but still, I don't think it's right of you.

88
00:10:23,203 --> 00:10:27,203
Just try to put yourself in Heidi's shoes.

89
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,291
There you are again.

90
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:59,291
Well, do you want to jump on the mountain now a little easier after the cold
bath?

91
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:20,667
Besides, it's not even my goat!

92
00:11:56,331 --> 00:12:02,331
Dede, think about it again with Heidi. The old öhi can't do anything with
children. He can't do anything with anyone.

93
00:12:02,331 --> 00:12:05,331
He will get used to it. He just has to work a little harder.

94
00:12:05,331 --> 00:12:07,331
Heidi! Heidi!

95
00:12:07,331 --> 00:12:12,331
She's running over there. She's running after Peter. She's well taken care of
there. Peter will be careful.

96
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:16,331
Heidi is used to taking care of herself. She will somehow get along.

97
00:12:16,988 --> 00:12:22,688
Hopefully you're right. Aldi is still quite small. She is only five years old
and she has got used to you.

98
00:12:22,688 --> 00:12:26,488
You can't just plant children like that. You can't even do that with trees.

99
00:12:40,038 --> 00:12:42,038
I always have to go after everyone.

100
00:12:43,038 --> 00:12:45,038
But slowly I also don't feel like it anymore.

101
00:12:52,134 --> 00:12:55,134
The old thing is coming down now.

102
00:13:05,862 --> 00:13:07,862
That too.

103
00:13:18,182 --> 00:13:20,182
Nanou?

104
00:13:20,182 --> 00:13:22,182
Why not?

105
00:13:22,182 --> 00:13:24,182
Not yet. It's much better in the underwear.

106
00:15:03,489 --> 00:15:05,489
From today on I was always the fastest.

107
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:07,489
From today on you know someone who is faster than you.

108
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,489
Where are you running to?

109
00:15:09,489 --> 00:15:11,489
To the Alpüi, that's where I live.

110
00:15:11,489 --> 00:15:13,489
What? You live at the old Krieskram?

111
00:15:13,489 --> 00:15:15,489
Yes, from today on.

112
00:15:15,489 --> 00:15:17,489
I don't believe you. No human is able to keep up with you.

113
00:15:19,489 --> 00:15:21,489
Maybe you'll make a face.

114
00:15:21,489 --> 00:15:23,489
Tell me, aren't you afraid at all?

115
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,489
Why? Should I?

116
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:27,489
Don't you know?

117
00:15:29,489 --> 00:15:30,823
Oh, forget it.

118
00:15:30,823 --> 00:15:33,823
Where are you going with all those goats if they don't belong to you?

119
00:15:33,823 --> 00:15:35,823
I'll bring them up the mountain and I'll take care of them.

120
00:15:35,823 --> 00:15:37,823
What do they want up there?

121
00:15:37,823 --> 00:15:39,823
Nothing special. They just want to eat.

122
00:15:39,823 --> 00:15:41,823
Nothing more?

123
00:15:46,081 --> 00:15:51,441
This is my goat. She barks like a dog. Then you live in the little house back
there.

124
00:15:51,441 --> 00:15:57,841
I guess we should hurry. The sun is going down soon.

125
00:15:57,841 --> 00:16:00,321
Come on, come on! Yes, good!

126
00:16:00,321 --> 00:16:07,201
So Heidi got to know the goat herder Peter. The two became thick friends very
soon.

127
00:16:07,201 --> 00:16:11,441
Peter got to know each other in the mountains and Heidi liked that.

128
00:16:11,441 --> 00:16:13,441
I have to weigh you now.

129
00:16:13,495 --> 00:16:17,695
Think about what I said. Heidi is nothing for the mountains. Take her with you.

130
00:16:17,695 --> 00:16:19,695
-Live well. -Live well, Barbel.

131
00:16:25,761 --> 00:16:28,261
-I'm coming. -Heidi, what do you look like?

132
00:16:28,261 --> 00:16:32,261
-What did you do with your clothes? -I just took them off, nothing else.

133
00:16:32,261 --> 00:16:35,261
You just threw them away? What did you think?

134
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:38,261
I was so hot, so I took them off.

135
00:16:38,261 --> 00:16:41,261
You took them off? Heidi, Heidi.

136
00:16:41,261 --> 00:16:45,261
Peter, be so nice and get the clothes back, okay?

137
00:16:45,261 --> 00:16:47,261
I'm sorry, but I don't have time.

138
00:16:47,261 --> 00:16:50,261
Maybe you have some time now.

139
00:16:50,261 --> 00:16:55,261
-Yes, I think so. -Well, you always have some time.

140
00:16:55,261 --> 00:16:55,543
Yes, I do.

141
00:16:55,543 --> 00:16:57,543
Yes, I will hurry up too.

142
00:17:00,543 --> 00:17:02,543
I'm coming with you. -You stay here.

143
00:17:11,617 --> 00:17:13,617
Thank you. Quick, the wind is coming again.

144
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,980
Good bye, grandfather.

145
00:18:15,772 --> 00:18:17,772
We have arrived.

146
00:18:21,772 --> 00:18:24,772
Greetings, you must be the Almöhi.

147
00:18:24,772 --> 00:18:26,772
That's me.

148
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,772
And with whom do I have the pleasure of speaking?

149
00:18:28,772 --> 00:18:30,772
With me.

150
00:18:31,772 --> 00:18:33,772
Oh, I'm about to burst.

151
00:18:33,772 --> 00:18:36,772
This is Heidi Almöhi, your niece.

152
00:18:39,772 --> 00:18:41,772
You won't recognize her anymore.

153
00:18:41,772 --> 00:18:44,772
The last time you saw her, she was a very small baby.

154
00:18:44,772 --> 00:18:46,600
A very small baby.

155
00:18:48,188 --> 00:18:50,188
You're late.

156
00:18:50,188 --> 00:18:51,188
Yes.

157
00:18:51,188 --> 00:18:53,188
Don't act as if you couldn't count to three.

158
00:18:53,188 --> 00:18:56,188
Make sure you bring the goats to the pasture and take mine with you.

159
00:18:58,188 --> 00:18:59,188
Wait!

160
00:18:59,188 --> 00:19:01,188
You stay here. You'll be needed in a moment, Heidi.

161
00:19:01,188 --> 00:19:03,188
Okay, Dede, say what you want.

162
00:19:03,188 --> 00:19:05,188
You definitely didn't bring the baby here for no reason.

163
00:19:05,188 --> 00:19:07,188
I know you.

164
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:10,188
I can't take care of her any longer. I want to leave her with you.

165
00:19:10,188 --> 00:19:11,188
What?

166
00:19:11,188 --> 00:19:13,074
There's no other way.

167
00:19:13,074 --> 00:19:16,874
I've been taking care of Heidi for the last four years. I've done what I could.

168
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:19,274
And now you're on the line, Almöhi.

169
00:19:20,474 --> 00:19:23,874
If you know that, then you can definitely explain to me

170
00:19:24,074 --> 00:19:28,674
what an old man like me should do in the middle of the mountains with a little
girl.

171
00:19:28,874 --> 00:19:31,874
You'll come up with something. And no matter what it is,

172
00:19:32,074 --> 00:19:34,874
it's finally time you took care of her.

173
00:19:35,772 --> 00:19:40,272
When Heidi's parents died, she was only a year old. Today she's five years old.

174
00:19:40,272 --> 00:19:43,772
It's finally time that you do something for her.

175
00:19:43,772 --> 00:19:46,272
After all, you're her next relative.

176
00:19:46,272 --> 00:19:49,272
Heidi is the daughter of your son. Don't forget that.

177
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:53,772
And if you don't want to keep her here, then do with her what you want.

178
00:19:53,772 --> 00:19:56,772
But whatever happens, it happens on your responsibility.

179
00:19:56,772 --> 00:20:01,772
But I assume you're so hard-hearted that you're not even interested in what will
happen to a little girl.

180
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:08,336
You don't seem to have ever heard the word "responsibility" before.

181
00:20:08,336 --> 00:20:11,836
You crawl up here and don't speak a word with a human soul.

182
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:15,336
What do you think you're doing? But that's all I can tell you.

183
00:20:15,336 --> 00:20:16,836
Out!

184
00:20:16,836 --> 00:20:18,336
Stop!

185
00:20:18,336 --> 00:20:19,836
You're not saying anything anymore.

186
00:20:19,836 --> 00:20:22,336
Make sure you finally get out of here.

187
00:20:22,336 --> 00:20:25,836
And don't you dare to look at me one more time.

188
00:20:25,836 --> 00:20:27,836
I've had enough of your gossip.

189
00:20:27,836 --> 00:20:29,336
Enough for once and for all.

190
00:20:29,336 --> 00:20:31,336
Take your things and go.

191
00:20:33,756 --> 00:20:35,756
Good-bye, Heidi.

192
00:20:35,756 --> 00:20:37,756
Be brave, little one,

193
00:20:37,756 --> 00:20:39,756
and please try to understand me.

194
00:20:39,756 --> 00:20:41,756
It will be all right.

195
00:20:45,276 --> 00:20:47,276
Live well, aunt Dete!

196
00:22:15,255 --> 00:22:18,255
I think I can get used to you

197
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:26,255
For Heidi it looked like it wouldn't be easy to live with this grandfather

198
00:22:26,255 --> 00:22:29,255
Why did he have to get used to her first?

199
00:22:29,255 --> 00:22:31,255
Couldn't he have her at the same time?

200
00:22:31,255 --> 00:22:34,255
Just like she liked Heidi from the beginning

201
00:22:46,263 --> 00:22:51,263
Heidi still couldn't know what her life would look like up here on the Alp

202
00:22:51,263 --> 00:22:54,263
For her everything was strange and full of adventures

203
00:22:54,263 --> 00:22:58,263
Every day there was something new to see and to learn

204
00:22:58,263 --> 00:23:00,263
And Heidi learned quickly

205
00:23:00,263 --> 00:23:08,263
It didn't take long and she knew exactly how she had to treat this Norwegian
grandfather that everyone in the village feared

206
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:12,263
The life of Nunan changed for the Alp too

207
00:23:12,263 --> 00:23:13,485
The one who was used to it

208
00:23:13,485 --> 00:23:21,765
to be alone, suddenly had a little overbearing guest. But we want to tell you
about that in our next story.
