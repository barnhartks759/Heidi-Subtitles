00:01:47,642 --> 00:01:50,442
Good morning, Clara. Aren't we going to the cabin this morning?

34
00:01:50,442 --> 00:01:52,442
Yes. Can we get up now?

35
00:01:52,442 --> 00:01:54,442
Yes.

36
00:01:59,706 --> 00:02:01,706
It's not even bright yet.

37
00:02:01,706 --> 00:02:03,706
Yes, I know, but I don't want to be late.

38
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:06,706
After all, we still have to wash and get dressed.

39
00:02:06,706 --> 00:02:08,706
I say it's a mess.

40
00:02:08,706 --> 00:02:11,706
Heidi, what's wrong with me?

41
00:02:11,706 --> 00:02:12,706
Why?

42
00:02:12,706 --> 00:02:14,706
You know, Heidi.

43
00:02:14,706 --> 00:02:16,706
The wheelchair.

44
00:02:20,314 --> 00:02:23,314
You just have to push him closer to my bed.

45
00:02:23,314 --> 00:02:25,314
Oh yes, good.

46
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,314
Can you hold him for a moment?

47
00:02:29,314 --> 00:02:31,314
Yes, will it work?

48
00:02:46,314 --> 00:02:48,314
Clara!

49
00:02:49,314 --> 00:02:51,314
What is it, Clara?

50
00:02:51,314 --> 00:02:53,314
Say something!

51
00:02:58,365 --> 00:03:01,365
Please ask Mrs. Rottenmeier if she can help me.

52
00:03:06,365 --> 00:03:07,365
What?

53
00:03:09,695 --> 00:03:12,695
How strange.

54
00:03:12,695 --> 00:03:14,695
Yes, tell me, what are you doing here?

55
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:18,695
Good morning. Oh, the milk is burning.

56
00:03:18,695 --> 00:03:21,695
Why are you cooking in our kitchen?

57
00:03:21,695 --> 00:03:26,695
I wonder too. As if I didn't have enough to do at home. But I'm supposed to help
here.

58
00:03:26,695 --> 00:03:30,695
Did Mrs. Rottenmeier go to you all by herself and asked?

59
00:03:30,695 --> 00:03:32,133
Yes.

60
00:03:32,133 --> 00:03:36,133
That's what she has. She's not really that friendly, I have to say.

61
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:41,133
Imagine, yesterday she suddenly stood up without knocking in the middle of the
living room.

62
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:45,133
She hasn't even apologized yet, but she says she would pay well.

63
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:48,133
And where is she? Has she already stood up or not?

64
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:52,133
Yes, for a long time. She's running around outside and putting her nose in
everywhere.

65
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:57,133
Well, then you have to help Clara. She's still lying in our room in bed.

66
00:03:57,133 --> 00:04:00,133
Oh, her name is Clara. Very pretty.

67
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:04,533
Heidi, who are you talking to? You'll see in a minute.

68
00:04:10,143 --> 00:04:12,143
Well, I thought so.

69
00:04:12,143 --> 00:04:14,143
Peter has to come too.

70
00:04:14,143 --> 00:04:16,143
Hopefully he won't forget it.

71
00:04:16,143 --> 00:04:17,143
Are you coming for breakfast?

72
00:04:17,143 --> 00:04:19,143
Yes, hopefully. Would you like some warm milk?

73
00:04:19,143 --> 00:04:21,143
Don't bring Mrs. Rottenmeier with you for breakfast.

74
00:04:21,143 --> 00:04:23,143
He's standing there. Peter!

75
00:04:23,143 --> 00:04:25,143
Huh? Yes?

76
00:04:29,471 --> 00:04:31,471
Good morning, Peter.

77
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,471
Good morning, Miss Clara.

78
00:04:33,471 --> 00:04:35,471
You don't have to say Miss.

79
00:04:35,471 --> 00:04:37,471
But I thought you do that in the city.

80
00:04:37,471 --> 00:04:39,471
They all talk so strangely there.

81
00:04:39,471 --> 00:04:41,471
Oh, what, Peter?

82
00:04:41,471 --> 00:04:43,471
Someone tied a bear to you.

83
00:04:43,471 --> 00:04:45,471
Can I say Clara?

84
00:04:45,471 --> 00:04:47,471
Yes, of course.

85
00:04:47,471 --> 00:04:49,471
I'll wait at the fountain for you until you have breakfast.

86
00:04:49,471 --> 00:04:51,471
Until then, goodbye.

87
00:04:51,471 --> 00:04:53,471
That can only be Joseph.

88
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:55,471
Yes, say Joseph.

89
00:04:55,471 --> 00:04:57,471
You can't even see where you're going.

90
00:04:58,901 --> 00:05:00,901
Joseflein, good morning.

91
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,501
That's my little dear Joseph.

92
00:05:03,501 --> 00:05:06,501
What? Little? He's everything but little.

93
00:05:07,101 --> 00:05:08,101
Doesn't he know?

94
00:05:08,701 --> 00:05:10,301
He doesn't even know how to do it.

95
00:05:10,501 --> 00:05:12,101
Well, I don't know.

96
00:05:12,901 --> 00:05:14,101
Come, Joseph.

97
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:16,701
Well, come.

98
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:23,501
I'm so happy to get to know you.

99
00:05:28,671 --> 00:05:31,671
I've never seen such a big dog.

100
00:05:32,671 --> 00:05:34,671
You're already dressed. That's good.

101
00:05:34,671 --> 00:05:36,671
Did you sleep well, Grandfather?

102
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:37,671
Good morning.

103
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:38,671
Good morning.

104
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,671
Well, what did you dream of tonight, my child?

105
00:05:41,671 --> 00:05:43,671
I don't know. I don't think anything.

106
00:05:43,671 --> 00:05:45,671
Then remember what you're dreaming of tonight.

107
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:49,671
You're babbling. It's only possible to fulfill what you dreamed of the first
night.

108
00:05:49,671 --> 00:05:50,671
Not exactly.

109
00:05:50,671 --> 00:05:52,671
Good morning, Mr. Oehi.

110
00:05:52,805 --> 00:05:54,205
Good morning.

111
00:05:54,205 --> 00:05:57,005
I have good news. I have solved the problem.

112
00:05:57,005 --> 00:05:58,805
I have asked the villagers.

113
00:05:58,805 --> 00:06:01,905
And the men are ready to declare to carry Clara.

114
00:06:01,905 --> 00:06:02,905
Who is carrying whom?

115
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:05,405
Two farmers. They are carrying Clara.

116
00:06:07,405 --> 00:06:08,405
Good morning.

117
00:06:10,705 --> 00:06:12,705
They seem to want to carry you.

118
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:13,905
It looks like it.

119
00:06:14,805 --> 00:06:17,405
What are you waiting for, gentlemen? What are you waiting for?

120
00:06:17,705 --> 00:06:18,705
Yes, well.

121
00:06:21,626 --> 00:06:24,626
We should have breakfast, children.

122
00:06:25,626 --> 00:06:27,626
Adelheid, you too, please.

123
00:06:35,626 --> 00:06:37,626
Did you see her face?

124
00:06:37,626 --> 00:06:38,626
Yes.

125
00:06:38,948 --> 00:06:40,948
Will you come for dinner?

126
00:06:47,556 --> 00:06:52,556
Peter, why are you sitting there? Come on, bring the goats up, it's about time.

127
00:06:53,556 --> 00:06:54,556
There!

128
00:06:54,556 --> 00:06:55,556
Where?

129
00:06:56,556 --> 00:06:58,556
What's that supposed to be?

130
00:06:59,556 --> 00:07:00,556
Good morning, Helene.

131
00:07:00,556 --> 00:07:01,556
Good morning.

132
00:07:04,556 --> 00:07:07,556
I feel like the princess in Aladdin and the Wonderlamp.

133
00:07:07,556 --> 00:07:09,556
Peter, it's about time.

134
00:07:09,556 --> 00:07:11,556
Heidi, is the ghost with you?

135
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,556
I'm sorry, please.

136
00:07:13,556 --> 00:07:15,556
Don't worry, I was happy to wait.

137
00:07:17,556 --> 00:07:18,556
It's okay.

138
00:07:18,724 --> 00:07:21,724
Well, good morning, Snuggie.

139
00:07:22,724 --> 00:07:24,724
Good morning, little Snuggie.

140
00:07:24,724 --> 00:07:25,724
You know her?

141
00:07:25,724 --> 00:07:28,724
Yes, I know her. There's Snuggie's daughter.

142
00:07:28,724 --> 00:07:30,724
And that's Snuggie.

143
00:07:34,724 --> 00:07:36,724
May I pet her too?

144
00:07:36,724 --> 00:07:37,724
Of course.

145
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:39,724
Here.

146
00:07:39,724 --> 00:07:40,724
How cute.

147
00:07:40,724 --> 00:07:45,724
Baa! Baa!

148
00:07:45,724 --> 00:07:48,724
Stay! She won't hurt you.

149
00:07:48,724 --> 00:07:50,724
Baa! Baa!

150
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:54,712
He's afraid of you, but it will be at some point.

151
00:07:54,712 --> 00:07:56,912
I see.

152
00:07:56,912 --> 00:07:59,712
You know, I can pet your little ghost after that.

153
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:02,412
Tell me, how do you know the little ghost?

154
00:08:02,412 --> 00:08:06,112
You would like to know that.

155
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:09,312
Over there, that's the old one.

156
00:08:11,312 --> 00:08:15,912
And the little colorful one has to be a child of the colorful one.

157
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:19,912
That's right.

158
00:08:20,186 --> 00:08:22,186
How did she know that?

159
00:08:22,186 --> 00:08:25,186
I don't understand why you're so surprised.

160
00:08:25,186 --> 00:08:27,186
You just know it that way.

161
00:08:36,388 --> 00:08:40,788
But Peter, that's quite easy. Heidi would have always written me all this.

162
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:45,288
Oh, that's why. I thought you were magic.

163
00:08:45,288 --> 00:08:47,288
Goat general.

164
00:08:47,288 --> 00:08:52,188
It's getting too late for us. Drive the goats. We still want to have something
from that day.

165
00:08:54,388 --> 00:08:57,888
What am I doing? Everywhere is wiggling of animals where you look.

166
00:08:57,888 --> 00:09:00,088
Sorry, too late, but finally yes.

167
00:09:01,488 --> 00:09:03,788
What a nightmare.

168
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:09,585
Why, this is your horse, and that's what you wanted to have after all.

169
00:09:09,585 --> 00:09:11,585
Yes, excuse me.

170
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:14,585
I thought of a very small one.

171
00:09:16,437 --> 00:09:18,437
What are you doing?

172
00:09:46,437 --> 00:10:01,757
Oh, nice!

173
00:10:01,757 --> 00:10:03,757
See you next time!

174
00:10:09,673 --> 00:10:11,673
The one you told me about looks exactly the same?

175
00:10:11,673 --> 00:10:14,673
Yes, exactly the same. Maybe he's even there.

176
00:10:28,673 --> 00:10:30,673
There comes Tito's goat, look!

178
00:10:41,161 --> 00:10:43,721
I think it's a pretty girl.

179
00:10:43,733 --> 00:11:03,733
It's beautiful. Can we stop for a moment?

180
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:07,733
There, Clara, the Alps.

181
00:11:13,733 --> 00:11:29,733
There, Clara, the Alps.

182
00:11:30,377 --> 00:11:35,377
How wonderful. It is much more beautiful than you described.

183
00:11:35,377 --> 00:11:37,377
Thank you, Heidi. I'm so happy.

184
00:11:37,377 --> 00:11:40,377
Clara, you don't have to thank me.

185
00:11:44,377 --> 00:11:47,305
Clara, look over there. That's our hut.

186
00:11:47,305 --> 00:11:50,305
I didn't think it would be so beautiful.

187
00:11:51,305 --> 00:11:52,305
I'm running!

188
00:11:55,305 --> 00:11:56,305
Peter, wait!

189
00:11:56,654 --> 00:11:58,654
Wait, I'll get Swandy and the other two.

190
00:12:02,654 --> 00:12:06,654
And these must be the geese that Heidi says they can talk to.

191
00:12:06,654 --> 00:12:09,654
Come on, little ghost, Clara is there.

192
00:12:09,654 --> 00:12:12,654
But she's cute. Little ghost, run, little ghost!

193
00:12:12,654 --> 00:12:14,654
Here, little ghost, come on, jump!

194
00:12:14,654 --> 00:12:16,654
Where is she going now?

195
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:18,654
But little ghost...

196
00:12:25,742 --> 00:12:27,742
She's really cute.

197
00:12:27,742 --> 00:12:29,742
Snuggie 2 is coming too.

198
00:12:29,742 --> 00:12:31,742
They're both the same, aren't they?

199
00:12:31,742 --> 00:12:33,742
I think so too.

200
00:12:48,206 --> 00:12:54,206
If you also want to come with us to our pasture, we have to slowly make our way.

201
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:56,206
What kind of pasture?

202
00:12:56,206 --> 00:12:59,206
Tell me, our pasture, what else?

203
00:12:59,206 --> 00:13:01,206
Oh, you know, Peter.

204
00:13:01,206 --> 00:13:06,206
Does that mean you stay here and don't go on?

205
00:13:06,206 --> 00:13:10,206
Mrs. Rottenmeier, please don't send her away. I want to go on.

206
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:15,206
Oh, what? It doesn't look different up there either. It was hard enough to get
here.

207
00:13:15,206 --> 00:13:18,206
You have to be able to be satisfied with something.

208
00:13:18,436 --> 00:13:23,136
I thank you, gentlemen. Please come back on time tonight.

209
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:26,136
We will. Until tonight, Almöhi.

210
00:13:26,136 --> 00:13:28,136
Up, come on.

211
00:13:30,136 --> 00:13:33,136
So, they're leaving.

212
00:13:33,136 --> 00:13:36,136
I thought so. Did you forget me again?

213
00:13:36,136 --> 00:13:38,136
Just because your girlfriend is here.

214
00:13:38,136 --> 00:13:41,136
But Peter, what's going on with you all of a sudden?

215
00:13:41,136 --> 00:13:43,136
How should I know?

216
00:13:43,136 --> 00:13:45,136
Stop it!

217
00:13:45,136 --> 00:13:48,136
I'm angry! That's with me!

218
00:13:48,136 --> 00:13:50,136
No! No!

219
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:53,190
Come on, didn't you hear him? He's whistling.

220
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:58,190
Sometimes you have to be strict with them.

221
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:01,190
Mrs. Clara, I'm sorry, but you have to rest.

222
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:03,190
Why?

223
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,190
Mrs. Rottenmeier was right. I'll help you.

224
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:07,190
Oh, Meier.

225
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:10,190
Oh, that's more comfortable.

226
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,190
Thank you very much, Ayme. Thank you.

227
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:23,150
To be continued

228
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:32,150
I still can't believe it. It's so beautiful and how blue the sky is.

229
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:43,150
Soft white clouds

230
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:46,150
And the wind is blowing

231
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,150
Yes, you're right, the sparrows are talking

232
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,150
Wait, I'll get you to them

233
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,150
Adelheid, leave your wheelchair!

234
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,150
No, I can do it

235
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,150
Let's go!

236
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,150
Adelheid, watch out!

237
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,150
Adelheid!

238
00:15:08,051 --> 00:15:12,051
Don't worry, it's not dangerous here. Nothing can happen here.

239
00:15:12,051 --> 00:15:14,051
That's what they say.

240
00:15:14,051 --> 00:15:17,051
You should hear how they roar when the autumn storms are here.

241
00:15:17,051 --> 00:15:19,051
I can imagine it.

242
00:15:30,051 --> 00:15:32,051
Sometimes they just whisper, but...

243
00:15:32,115 --> 00:15:38,115
But when the wind is strong, they scream and in the winter the animals hide
among them and seek protection.

244
00:15:39,115 --> 00:15:42,115
I also want to experience all of that.

245
00:15:47,115 --> 00:15:51,115
They are really huge. Do you know how old they are already, Heidi?

246
00:15:51,115 --> 00:15:54,115
No, they were already there when Grandfather came.

247
00:15:55,115 --> 00:15:58,115
I can tell you everything. They understand everything.

248
00:16:02,115 --> 00:16:04,115
I can tell you everything.

249
00:16:05,171 --> 00:16:09,171
I had to get so old to experience that.

250
00:16:09,171 --> 00:16:12,171
No one knows what can happen here.

251
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,171
Dangerous sources everywhere.

252
00:16:17,171 --> 00:16:20,171
She will have to get used to it.

253
00:16:24,171 --> 00:16:25,715
Here you can...

254
00:16:25,715 --> 00:16:28,715
Food? Nobody came up with that idea at home.

255
00:16:28,715 --> 00:16:32,715
I hope you're hungry. I've made a lot of food and I have to eat it.

256
00:16:32,715 --> 00:16:37,715
Oh yes, I'm hungry. I've never had as much hunger in my life as I have today.

257
00:16:37,715 --> 00:16:39,715
It'll take another minute.

258
00:16:39,715 --> 00:16:40,715
Are you calling us?

259
00:16:44,715 --> 00:16:46,715
Don't be afraid, it won't happen.

260
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:47,715
We're going to crash!

261
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:57,715
Phew!

262
00:17:03,891 --> 00:17:05,891
Watch out, she's falling over.

263
00:17:06,891 --> 00:17:09,891
Somehow you have to be more careful about her than about me.

264
00:17:10,891 --> 00:17:12,891
Why aren't you coming? The food is ready.

265
00:17:13,891 --> 00:17:16,891
Finally! I didn't think you'd be here any longer!

266
00:17:23,891 --> 00:17:24,891
Another one!

267
00:17:24,915 --> 00:17:29,915
Oh, I don't recognize you at all, Mrs. Clara. In Frankfurt, you eat like a
sport.

268
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:34,915
I don't like it that much either. No one has ever given me such delicious cheese
bread.

269
00:17:34,915 --> 00:17:39,915
That only makes the fresh air. Eat slowly, my child, so that you get red cheeks.

270
00:17:39,915 --> 00:17:41,915
Here, Clara. Thank you.

271
00:17:42,915 --> 00:17:44,915
You haven't had a single sip yet.

272
00:17:44,915 --> 00:17:48,915
What? Yes, I don't like it at the moment. I'll drink my milk later.

273
00:17:48,915 --> 00:17:52,915
If you let her stand too long, she won't be fresh anymore and won't taste so
good anymore.

274
00:17:54,915 --> 00:17:55,177
To be continued

275
00:17:55,177 --> 00:17:58,177
Hey Heidi, will you show me your hut after dinner?

276
00:18:03,896 --> 00:18:06,696
Oh, what a huge pot!

277
00:18:06,696 --> 00:18:09,696
That's what the grandfather and I always make the cheese together.

278
00:18:09,696 --> 00:18:14,496
Aha! Is that the ladder back there that you always have to climb up?

279
00:18:14,496 --> 00:18:15,496
Yes, exactly!

280
00:18:15,496 --> 00:18:18,896
Aha! I would like to see it so much!

281
00:18:18,896 --> 00:18:20,896
Then you will see it too.

282
00:18:29,752 --> 00:18:31,752
This is my bed, Clara.

283
00:18:31,752 --> 00:18:34,752
How good it smells. Is that the hay that smells so good?

284
00:18:34,752 --> 00:18:35,752
Yes.

285
00:18:38,752 --> 00:18:40,752
Oh, you can see the sun shining.

286
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:44,752
Not only that, in the evening you can also see the moon and the stars.

287
00:18:44,752 --> 00:18:46,752
If there are no clouds.

288
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:50,752
Of course, you smartass. I would like to sleep here too.

289
00:18:50,752 --> 00:18:53,752
I would love to stay up here in the hut right away.

290
00:18:53,752 --> 00:18:56,752
Oh yes, we stay up here. We won't go down again.

291
00:18:56,752 --> 00:18:58,286
It would be nice.

292
00:18:58,286 --> 00:19:00,286
That's not allowed in Rottenmeier.

293
00:19:00,286 --> 00:19:03,286
Why not? Just ask her.

294
00:19:03,286 --> 00:19:06,286
We can take care of you up here as well as we can take care of you down here.

295
00:19:06,286 --> 00:19:07,286
Do it!

296
00:19:07,286 --> 00:19:10,286
But you have to ask her if you want to. I'm sure she won't allow it.

297
00:19:10,286 --> 00:19:12,286
She'll definitely start screaming.

298
00:19:12,286 --> 00:19:14,286
It's not even a question.

299
00:19:15,286 --> 00:19:17,286
And why not?

300
00:19:17,286 --> 00:19:19,286
Why, why, why? It's too dangerous.

301
00:19:19,286 --> 00:19:24,286
I admit that the murmel animals up here can live quite well, but certainly not
humans.

302
00:19:24,286 --> 00:19:27,286
Grandfather and I are also humans and we live quite well here.

303
00:19:27,822 --> 00:19:30,622
Yes, of course, but that's something completely different.

304
00:19:30,622 --> 00:19:32,122
That's nothing at all.

305
00:19:32,122 --> 00:19:33,122
Oh, yes.

306
00:19:33,122 --> 00:19:35,422
I can understand that you are worried about Clara.

307
00:19:35,422 --> 00:19:36,822
It is unusual for you here.

308
00:19:36,822 --> 00:19:40,022
But please don't forget that Heidi and I know each other up here.

309
00:19:40,022 --> 00:19:41,622
We can take care of Clara.

310
00:19:41,622 --> 00:19:43,722
No, I don't think you can.

311
00:19:43,722 --> 00:19:45,622
Clara is not comparable to Heidi.

312
00:19:45,622 --> 00:19:48,622
Where do you actually take the right of Mr. Rottenmeier

313
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:50,622
to want to know better than the secret?

314
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:53,222
After all, he was the one who sent Clara here.

315
00:19:54,686 --> 00:20:00,686
He came to see everything here, isn't that right, Mrs. Rottenmeier, or did I get
it wrong?

316
00:20:00,686 --> 00:20:05,686
No, the secret guard sent me here on purpose because he liked it so much.

317
00:20:05,686 --> 00:20:07,686
Yes, he did.

318
00:20:07,686 --> 00:20:13,686
Oh, I don't know where my head is anymore, maybe it's good here for you, maybe
not, but I can't live here.

319
00:20:13,686 --> 00:20:16,686
I can't stand it, there are abysses everywhere.

320
00:20:16,686 --> 00:20:18,686
But Mrs. Rottenmeier...

321
00:20:19,086 --> 00:20:22,586
Yes, it's all right, I'm sorry, I've been caught again.

322
00:20:22,586 --> 00:20:26,086
You can live in the village if you don't like it up here.

323
00:20:26,086 --> 00:20:29,086
And how do you imagine that I will take care of you?

324
00:20:29,086 --> 00:20:32,586
You can come up every day and look at the right.

325
00:20:32,586 --> 00:20:33,586
That's impossible.

326
00:20:33,586 --> 00:20:34,586
There they come.

327
00:20:39,928 --> 00:20:46,428
Ah yes, we're being picked up. Now please be reasonable again and come down with
me.

328
00:20:46,428 --> 00:20:48,928
I stay, I don't go with you.

329
00:20:48,928 --> 00:20:50,928
Please?

330
00:20:50,928 --> 00:20:52,928
You are disobedient?

331
00:20:52,928 --> 00:20:54,928
Yes.

332
00:20:54,928 --> 00:20:56,928
Good.

333
00:20:56,928 --> 00:21:02,928
As you wish. But I'll make you responsible if something happens to the child.

334
00:21:03,677 --> 00:21:05,077
You can stay, Clara.

335
00:21:05,077 --> 00:21:06,377
That's nice, isn't it?

336
00:21:06,377 --> 00:21:09,577
I will come every morning and see if you are doing well.

337
00:21:09,577 --> 00:21:12,577
Please take your breakfast on time at 7 o'clock.

338
00:21:12,577 --> 00:21:14,177
And don't forget your studies.

339
00:21:14,177 --> 00:21:16,877
Unfortunately, I have to make up your decision.

340
00:21:16,877 --> 00:21:18,177
Live well.

341
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:21,577
I've never had such a big neck in my whole life.

342
00:21:22,577 --> 00:21:24,477
Goodbye, Mrs. Rottenmeier.

343
00:21:24,477 --> 00:21:25,577
Goodbye.

344
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:29,177
Don't forget that you have to pick up your studies from today.

345
00:21:32,077 --> 00:21:32,977
Is Peter coming?

346
00:21:32,977 --> 00:21:33,977
Yes.

347
00:21:34,557 --> 00:21:36,557
Let's go!

348
00:21:40,557 --> 00:21:42,557
Hello, Peter!

349
00:21:50,205 --> 00:21:52,205
I brought something for you.

350
00:21:52,205 --> 00:21:53,205
Thank you.

351
00:21:53,205 --> 00:21:54,205
How nice of you.

352
00:21:54,205 --> 00:21:56,205
Thank you very much.

353
00:21:56,205 --> 00:21:57,205
Thank you, Peter.

354
00:21:57,205 --> 00:21:59,205
You are wonderful, beautiful.

355
00:22:05,245 --> 00:22:08,245
Yes, Schnucki, good evening, pretty little ghost.

356
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:11,245
No, that's not true. That's Schnucki and that's little ghost.

357
00:22:23,229 --> 00:22:27,569
Heidi und Klara hatten an diesem Abend noch lange miteinander getuschelt und
gekichert.

358
00:22:27,569 --> 00:22:32,709
Sie hatten sich so unendlich viel zu erzählen, aber dann fielen ihnen
schließlich doch vor

359
00:22:32,709 --> 00:22:37,669
Übermüdung die Augen zu und sie träumten von all dem schönen, das sie noch
zusammen erleben würden.

360
00:22:49,245 --> 00:22:52,245
The next day they both stood up in the sun.

361
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:55,245
Clara could not find herself at all at the first moment.

362
00:22:55,245 --> 00:22:59,245
But then, when she looked out the window and saw the flowers,

363
00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:03,245
the mountains shining in the sunlight, she knew again where she was.

364
00:23:03,245 --> 00:23:06,245
Everything could have been beautiful,

365
00:23:06,245 --> 00:23:10,245
if not for a reason for complaining by Mrs. Rottenmeier.

366
00:23:10,245 --> 00:23:13,245
Heidi, however, did not let her good mood be spoiled.

367
00:23:13,245 --> 00:23:18,245
Together with Peter, she thought of a new surprise for Clara every day.

368
00:23:18,611 --> 00:23:23,111
But we want to tell you about it in our next story.

369
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:31,111
Heidi, Heidi, your world is the mountains.

370
00:23:31,111 --> 00:23:39,111
Heidi, Heidi, because up here you are at home.

371
00:23:39,111 --> 00:23:45,111
Heidi, Heidi, come home.

372
00:23:45,111 --> 00:23:47,111
Find your happiness.

373
00:23:47,111 --> 00:23:52,111
Come back home.
