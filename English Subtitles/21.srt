1
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:27,626
The mountains are the world

2
00:00:28,038 --> 00:00:32,038
Heidi, Heidi

3
00:00:32,038 --> 00:00:36,038
because up here you are at home

4
00:00:36,038 --> 00:00:40,038
dark fir trees

5
00:00:40,038 --> 00:00:44,038
green meadows in the sunshine

6
00:00:44,038 --> 00:00:48,038
Heidi, Heidi

7
00:00:48,038 --> 00:00:52,038
you need to be happy

8
00:00:52,038 --> 00:00:54,038
Heidi, Heidi

9
00:00:54,038 --> 00:00:56,038
Heidi, Heidi

10
00:00:56,038 --> 00:00:58,038
Heidi, Heidi

11
00:00:58,038 --> 00:01:00,038
Heidi, Heidi

12
00:01:00,038 --> 00:01:02,038
Heidi, Heidi

13
00:01:06,038 --> 00:01:10,038
Heidi, Heidi

14
00:01:10,038 --> 00:01:12,038
come home

15
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:14,038
find your happiness

16
00:01:14,038 --> 00:01:18,038
come back home

17
00:01:19,386 --> 00:01:23,386
Heidi wanted Clara to stay in Frankfurt for a few days.

18
00:01:23,386 --> 00:01:25,386
The sick girl was sorry for her.

19
00:01:25,386 --> 00:01:30,386
And Heidi felt that Clara, despite the many servants, was very lonely.

20
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,490
So you are the little nobility from the mountains?

21
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,490
Don't be afraid of him.

22
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,490
My name is Heidi.

23
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:46,490
Oh, like that?

24
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:49,490
Her name is nobility. She just doesn't want to understand it because she's so
stubborn.

25
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,490
No normal child is called Heidi.

26
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,490
Besides, it's not your job, Miss Clara, to push the chair.

27
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,490
We have servants in the house for that. They can do something for their wages.

28
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,490
Why? It's fun for me.

29
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:01,490
Nonsense!

30
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,490
Excuse me, Mr. Candidate. You won't have it easy.

31
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,490
She has no manners at all.

32
00:02:07,472 --> 00:02:10,472
She confuses us with the staff.

33
00:02:10,472 --> 00:02:13,472
And I tell you, she has never read the Bible in her life.

34
00:02:13,472 --> 00:02:17,472
Well, Heidi can't read, but she knows many other things.

35
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:20,472
Her name is nobility, remember that.

36
00:02:20,472 --> 00:02:24,472
Go and wait in the study room. I have something to discuss with your teacher.

37
00:02:25,472 --> 00:02:27,472
Fine, then we can talk.

38
00:02:30,472 --> 00:02:34,472
Bring the children to the study room and close the door, please.

39
00:02:36,986 --> 00:02:45,986
I'm terribly desperate. I fell in. What should I do?

40
00:02:45,986 --> 00:02:48,986
Oh, what? It will be. All we need is time.

41
00:02:48,986 --> 00:02:50,986
Best I start with the alphabet.

42
00:02:50,986 --> 00:02:53,986
No, that would throw Mrs. Clara back.

43
00:02:53,986 --> 00:02:55,986
Should she deal with the alphabet again now?

44
00:02:55,986 --> 00:02:58,986
No, you have to go on where you are now.

45
00:02:58,986 --> 00:03:00,986
That's impossible. I can't answer that.

46
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,320
Oh yes, if you put in the effort, then you can do it too.

47
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,520
Please, I know you, but you will surely come up with a solution.

48
00:03:19,354 --> 00:03:22,354
Why are you stooping all the time?

49
00:03:22,354 --> 00:03:25,354
I can't sit well on the chair.

50
00:03:25,354 --> 00:03:27,354
Is it too hard for you?

51
00:03:27,354 --> 00:03:30,354
No, no, too soft.

52
00:03:30,354 --> 00:03:33,354
What kind of chairs did you sit on in the mountains?

53
00:03:33,354 --> 00:03:37,354
Wooden chairs. Grandfather made a chair especially for me.

54
00:03:37,354 --> 00:03:40,354
You could sit on it so well.

55
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:42,354
Yes, that's for you.

56
00:03:42,354 --> 00:03:44,354
Mine?

57
00:03:44,354 --> 00:03:47,040
Joseph, I have a chair! My first...

58
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,040
My own chair! Chair, chair, chair! What a beautiful chair!

59
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,040
If you tip over, we'll be scolded again. That's not a swing chair. Be careful.

60
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,040
Can't you move when you learn?

61
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,040
Yes, that's exactly how it is.

62
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,040
You have to sit still, listen to the teacher and be careful that you don't miss
anything.

63
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,040
Oh...

64
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,040
But the stupid thing is, if you sit still all the time, you usually get tired.

65
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,040
But you're going to hurt.

66
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,040
What?

67
00:04:16,272 --> 00:04:18,272
I'm not allowed to walk when I'm tired?

68
00:04:18,272 --> 00:04:19,272
No, for heaven's sake.

69
00:04:19,272 --> 00:04:21,272
And that's what you call studying.

70
00:04:21,272 --> 00:04:24,272
I really imagined something completely different from that.

71
00:04:24,272 --> 00:04:27,272
I think that's too boring for me. I'm not taking part in that.

72
00:04:27,272 --> 00:04:29,272
Don't you want to learn to read?

73
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:41,402
Joseph walks 20 times a day and Grandfather never shouts.

74
00:04:44,402 --> 00:04:47,402
And who is this Joseph who walks 20 times a day?

75
00:04:47,402 --> 00:04:49,402
A big, lovely dog, of course.

76
00:04:49,402 --> 00:04:52,402
If you walk here, you have to swallow medicine right away.

77
00:04:54,402 --> 00:04:58,402
I don't even know what to do with it. It's so bitter that you get sick right
away.

78
00:04:58,402 --> 00:05:00,402
That's why go first when ...

79
00:05:04,698 --> 00:05:08,698
Between the two of us, everything would probably be discussed.

80
00:05:17,698 --> 00:05:21,698
We will continue in the school hour where we were standing yesterday.

81
00:05:21,698 --> 00:05:23,698
Understood?

82
00:05:25,698 --> 00:05:28,698
I suspect it will be a bit difficult for you at the beginning.

83
00:05:28,698 --> 00:05:30,698
But it will be fine with a little effort.

84
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:32,698
We're here.

85
00:05:32,698 --> 00:05:33,698
Here?

86
00:05:33,698 --> 00:05:34,698
Here.

87
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:49,730
Let's find out what you can do at all.

88
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:54,730
The difficulties of German big and small writing do not exist for other
languages,

89
00:05:54,730 --> 00:06:00,730
because they have gone over to the small writing of all words with the exception
of the name and the sentence at the beginning.

90
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,730
You always write the first word of a whole sentence in large.

91
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:07,730
This is how you write in the cow comes home the big.

92
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:10,730
We always had goats.

93
00:06:12,922 --> 00:06:21,522
Second, you always write big after a double point. An example, instructions for
use, double point.

94
00:06:21,522 --> 00:06:28,882
You take a spoonful of rizinus oil every two hours. In this case you write man,

95
00:06:28,882 --> 00:06:32,242
of course, big. Third, you write all the main words big.

96
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:57,720
Heaven, earth, childhood, family, responsibility, stranger, dog, cat, chicken,
canary, bird, flowers, grasses, trees, wind, sun, mountains, water, land, sleep,
dream, happiness, spring, winter, snow, hare, deer, aunt, mother, father, uncle,
sister, brother, friend, grandfather.

97
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,720
The grandfather is there? Where? Don't run away, I'm coming.

98
00:07:02,384 --> 00:07:04,384
Oh dear.

99
00:07:04,384 --> 00:07:05,384
Manu!

100
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:06,054
Grandfather!

101
00:07:06,054 --> 00:07:08,054
Grandfather, we're up here! 老大,我们在这里!

102
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,054
Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! 噢不!噢不!噢不!

103
00:07:11,054 --> 00:07:13,054
The carpet, the ink, the diva, quick, quick! 快点,快点,快点!

104
00:07:13,054 --> 00:07:15,054
To help, to help! 帮帮!帮帮!

105
00:07:15,054 --> 00:07:17,054
Of course, as always, no one to help! 当然,无人帮帮!

106
00:07:18,054 --> 00:07:20,054
Grandfather! 老大!

107
00:07:36,054 --> 00:07:38,054
Grandfather! 老大!

108
00:07:38,938 --> 00:07:40,938
Now I have already dreamed again.

109
00:07:41,938 --> 00:07:43,938
No trees and no mountains.

110
00:07:44,938 --> 00:07:48,938
I am in Frankfurt, no grandfather and no Peter and no goats.

111
00:07:48,938 --> 00:07:50,938
Oh, Deloitte!

112
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:54,938
Now I am curious what excuse you come up with again.

113
00:07:54,938 --> 00:07:56,938
I thought the grandfather had come.

114
00:07:57,938 --> 00:08:02,938
And I thought I could hear the wind and see the firs and the mountains and the
flowers.

115
00:08:02,938 --> 00:08:04,938
Trees? Here in Frankfurt?

116
00:08:05,938 --> 00:08:06,938
Uh-huh.

117
00:08:07,322 --> 00:08:11,322
You're talking nonsense. We're not in the forest.

118
00:08:11,322 --> 00:08:14,322
Come back in. We can't interrupt your class because of you.

119
00:08:14,322 --> 00:08:15,322
Not so fast!

120
00:08:19,322 --> 00:08:22,322
Take a look at what you've done, Adelheid.

121
00:08:23,322 --> 00:08:25,322
I'm really sorry.

122
00:08:25,322 --> 00:08:29,322
If you don't sit on the chair in the future, I'll tie you up, understood?

123
00:08:33,402 --> 00:08:37,402
I can now see how I can get the stain off again, because you did it.

124
00:08:37,402 --> 00:08:40,402
I'm really sorry. I can help him.

125
00:08:40,402 --> 00:08:43,402
Leave your fingers out of it. I don't want to get in any more trouble.

126
00:08:43,402 --> 00:08:46,402
Mrs. Clara is waiting in her room for you.

127
00:08:46,402 --> 00:08:47,402
I should arrange that.

128
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:48,402
Yes?

129
00:08:53,434 --> 00:08:55,934
You had dreamed of the mountains.

130
00:08:55,934 --> 00:08:59,374
Do you still not like it here in Frankfurt?

131
00:08:59,374 --> 00:09:03,374
No, I will never like it as much as at home.

132
00:09:03,374 --> 00:09:06,834
I can't even imagine what it looks like there. Can you describe it?

133
00:09:06,834 --> 00:09:10,974
Yes, I can try it, but it takes a lot of time, you know.

134
00:09:10,974 --> 00:09:12,074
We have them.

135
00:09:12,074 --> 00:09:14,074
Yes, but ...

136
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:22,810
His name is Hansi. I got him for his birthday.

137
00:09:30,586 --> 00:09:33,586
Why did you lock Hansi in a cage?

138
00:09:33,586 --> 00:09:34,586
What?

139
00:09:34,586 --> 00:09:37,586
Birds want to fly free. That's why they have wings.

140
00:09:37,586 --> 00:09:40,586
If I let him fly free, will he fly away?

141
00:09:40,586 --> 00:09:45,586
I once had a bird that was allowed to fly anywhere. His name was Peep.

142
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:48,586
What? You can't keep a bird without a cage.

143
00:09:48,586 --> 00:09:51,586
Yes, Peep did. I pulled him up and let him fly free.

144
00:09:51,586 --> 00:09:53,586
That must have been very nice.

145
00:09:53,586 --> 00:09:54,586
Oh yes, and how!

146
00:09:54,592 --> 00:09:58,992
But the bird wasn't my only friend. I have so many friends in the mountains.

147
00:09:58,992 --> 00:09:59,492
Really?

148
00:09:59,492 --> 00:10:01,492
At least a hundred thousand.

149
00:10:01,492 --> 00:10:03,492
Open a drawer.

150
00:10:06,492 --> 00:10:09,492
They're not alive, but I like them very much.

151
00:10:11,492 --> 00:10:13,492
She looks like you.

152
00:10:14,992 --> 00:10:17,992
It's a sleeping doll. She can open and close her eyes.

153
00:10:24,474 --> 00:10:26,474
She looks very lively.

154
00:10:26,474 --> 00:10:29,474
I have a lot of nice things. Open the closet.

155
00:10:30,474 --> 00:10:32,474
More dolls?

156
00:10:36,474 --> 00:10:38,474
Are these all your clothes?

157
00:10:38,474 --> 00:10:41,474
Yes, of course. Do you have as many clothes as me?

158
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,474
Me?

159
00:10:45,474 --> 00:10:49,474
Is this your only dress? There's more in the closet.

160
00:10:54,474 --> 00:10:57,402
Subtitles by Stephanie Geiges

161
00:10:57,402 --> 00:10:59,402
Do all animals belong in the hut?

162
00:10:59,402 --> 00:11:00,402
Yes, of course.

163
00:11:01,902 --> 00:11:03,902
Grandfather also gave me one.

164
00:11:03,902 --> 00:11:04,902
Wait, I'll get it.

165
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:14,506
What do you say to that?

166
00:11:14,506 --> 00:11:16,506
Oh, I've never seen such a hat before.

167
00:11:22,506 --> 00:11:26,506
Adelaide here? Without my explicit permission, you have nothing to look for
here.

168
00:11:26,506 --> 00:11:29,506
She can't do anything about it. I wished that she came here.

169
00:11:29,506 --> 00:11:31,506
Then you just wished something wrong.

170
00:11:31,506 --> 00:11:34,506
This room will only be entered if I have given my consent to it.

171
00:11:34,506 --> 00:11:36,506
Did I express myself clearly?

172
00:11:36,506 --> 00:11:37,506
Yes.

173
00:11:37,506 --> 00:11:38,506
Come.

174
00:11:42,506 --> 00:11:44,506
Adelaide!

175
00:11:46,522 --> 00:11:48,522
Mrs. Clara has to rest in the afternoon.

176
00:11:48,522 --> 00:11:51,522
At this time you can do whatever you like.

177
00:11:51,522 --> 00:11:53,522
But please don't put this disgusting hat on your head!

178
00:11:53,522 --> 00:11:54,522
No!

179
00:11:54,522 --> 00:11:57,522
Who knows if this hat has even been in the goat stable?

180
00:11:57,522 --> 00:11:59,522
Horrible thought!

181
00:11:59,522 --> 00:12:01,522
Give me my hat back! No!

182
00:12:01,522 --> 00:12:03,522
I want my hat back!

183
00:12:04,794 --> 00:12:06,794
Why is she so mean?

184
00:12:18,294 --> 00:12:20,250
My hat, my own!

185
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:27,250
A hat, a hat, a hat, a hat, my hat, I have my own hat, a hat, a hat, a good one,
a good one.

186
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:32,250
Peacock, come back, look at my hat. Grandfather gave me a hat.

187
00:12:36,378 --> 00:12:38,378
Slow down!

188
00:13:08,726 --> 00:13:10,726
Thanks for watching and see you next time!

189
00:13:15,898 --> 00:13:18,898
Do you want to fly back home into the mountains?

190
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,898
I would love to.

191
00:13:23,898 --> 00:13:25,898
Come out!

192
00:13:29,178 --> 00:13:34,178
You can fly home. I'm here now. Clara is not alone anymore. Come on, Peep Matt.

193
00:13:38,178 --> 00:13:39,178
Don't be afraid.

194
00:13:39,802 --> 00:13:41,802
That's good.

195
00:13:44,802 --> 00:13:45,802
Peep, Matz.

196
00:13:45,802 --> 00:13:47,802
Around and around in a circle.

197
00:13:47,802 --> 00:13:49,802
Around and around in a circle.

198
00:13:53,802 --> 00:13:55,802
And now I'll open the window for you.

199
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:57,802
Then you can fly outside.

200
00:14:03,002 --> 00:14:07,002
What are you waiting for? The window is open. Come on, Piepmatz.

201
00:14:11,002 --> 00:14:14,002
Greet Piepmatz from me when you should see him, okay?

202
00:14:19,002 --> 00:14:20,002
Or come on.

203
00:14:21,002 --> 00:14:27,002
Oh! Oh! Oh no! I move very calmly.

204
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:32,130
Stay still! Don't move! Don't scare my children!

205
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:34,130
Hansi, hurry!

206
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:42,130
Hansi, Hansi, Hansi, Hansi, Hansi, Hansi, Hansileute, Hansileute!

207
00:14:42,554 --> 00:14:44,554
Oh dear, what is that?

208
00:14:44,554 --> 00:14:46,554
It must be Heidi.

209
00:14:46,554 --> 00:14:48,554
Why? If it goes on like this, I'll die!

210
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,554
The favorite bird of Mrs. Leibniz!

211
00:14:50,554 --> 00:14:52,554
What are they doing there?

212
00:14:52,554 --> 00:14:55,554
Are you going to get away from me, you nasty child?

213
00:14:55,554 --> 00:14:57,554
No, stop!

214
00:15:11,664 --> 00:15:22,944
I didn't want to do anything bad, my bird was allowed to...

215
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:27,970
You can fly anywhere you want, Hansi, I'm sorry, no bird wants to be in the
cage.

216
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,970
Oh, what? Oh, what? Oh, what? I'm sorry for your eternal apologies.

217
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,970
You'll be locked up for as long as you come to your senses, bastard.

218
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,970
Whoever doesn't want to hear must feel.

219

220
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,458
It's cold in here.

221
00:16:08,602 --> 00:16:10,602
icecold

222
00:17:12,986 --> 00:17:14,986
It's very quiet without you.

223
00:17:14,986 --> 00:17:18,986
Tinette, please go and get this terrible child out of the basement.

224
00:17:18,986 --> 00:17:21,986
Yes, Mademoiselle Rottenmeier.

225
00:17:23,986 --> 00:17:25,986
You may come out.

226
00:17:27,986 --> 00:17:31,986
Mademoiselle Rottenmeier said you should come, Adelaide.

227
00:17:31,986 --> 00:17:33,986
Now hurry up.

228
00:17:34,986 --> 00:17:36,986
Oh, you're impossible.

229
00:17:38,986 --> 00:17:39,986
Come with me.

230
00:17:42,986 --> 00:17:44,890
Come with me.

231
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,890
What's wrong with her?

232
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:50,890
Mademoiselle, come quickly, quickly, quickly, this terrible child!

233
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:53,890
Stop screaming at this point!

234
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,890
What are you doing down there?

235
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:59,890
Adelheid, what are you doing there with your skirt?

236
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,890
Shut up!

237
00:18:09,178 --> 00:18:12,178
You seem to have improved and want to show something.

238
00:18:12,178 --> 00:18:15,178
Aren't they cute in Rottenmeier?

239
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,178
Yes.

240
00:18:17,178 --> 00:18:19,178
Mice! Mice!

241
00:18:19,178 --> 00:18:21,178
Real mice?

242
00:18:21,178 --> 00:18:24,178
Don't let them fall! I'll hit you!

243
00:18:30,362 --> 00:18:32,362
They don't do anything.

244
00:18:37,362 --> 00:18:39,362
Look, they are so cute.

245
00:18:45,362 --> 00:18:47,362
Look at them.

246
00:18:51,034 --> 00:18:54,034
You're right, somewhere they are very cute.

247
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:59,034
They are nice, but rather take them away, yes?

248
00:18:59,034 --> 00:19:02,034
If they stay away for so long, their mother thinks they have run away.

249
00:19:02,034 --> 00:19:04,034
Well, if you think so.

250
00:19:04,034 --> 00:19:08,034
Clara, why did they get so upset earlier?

251
00:19:09,034 --> 00:19:10,034
Just like that.

252
00:19:15,258 --> 00:19:19,258
Look how fast they are.

253
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:23,258
No one is picking them up anymore.

254
00:19:23,258 --> 00:19:27,258
No one is picking them up anymore.

255
00:19:27,258 --> 00:19:31,258
No more mice to be seen, Madame.

256
00:19:31,258 --> 00:19:35,258
Are you sure? Maybe there is one left.

257
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:38,258
There is nowhere to find the smallest spark of a mouse.

258
00:19:38,258 --> 00:19:39,258
Don't worry.

259
00:19:39,258 --> 00:19:41,258
I will make sure that this is true.

260
00:19:41,258 --> 00:19:43,258
All mice are on and off.

261
00:19:43,258 --> 00:19:46,258
Take care of the tapes, Madame.

262
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,250
My poor nerves.

263
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:54,250
Another day like this and I have to change my job.

264
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,250
Poverty.

265
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,250
Screaming doesn't help at all.

266
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,250
You didn't do it any other way.

267
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,250
I'm cold.

268
00:20:04,358 --> 00:20:06,358
I'm cold.

269
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,358
I'm cold.

270
00:20:51,034 --> 00:20:53,034
The bird is back!

271
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:55,034
Yes, imagine it. It came back.

272
00:20:55,034 --> 00:20:59,034
But I knew all along that it was coming back. It belongs here.

273
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:07,930
What happened? Why didn't you fly home to the mountains?

274
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:10,930
He feels better in his cage than somewhere out there.

275
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:12,930
Here he is at home. Out there he is strange.

276
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:15,930
No, no, no, I don't believe that.

277
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:22,930
But Heidi, not everyone is like you. The bird doesn't know your mountains at
all.

278
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:27,930
He is like me. He feels good here in this house because he hasn't met anything
else yet.

279
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,930
Never.

280
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:32,930
Oh yes, this bird is happy here with me.

281
00:21:33,504 --> 00:21:37,704
You pulled up your bird, I pulled up this one.

282
00:21:37,704 --> 00:21:43,204
But first you have to see how happy the birds are in the mountains when they can
fly freely over the meadows.

283
00:21:43,204 --> 00:21:52,204
They flutter and fly high through the air, all the way up to the sky and higher
and higher and fly and fly and fly and fly and fly and fly.

284
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,458
Did I offend you?

285
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:02,458
Kids, dinner is ready!

286
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:03,458
Huh?

287
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:07,458
This time we have to hurry, otherwise we'll be scolded again.

288
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:09,458
Okay, let's go! Hold on tight!

289
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:14,458
You know what, Clara? I just thought of something.

290
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,458
One day I'll take you to the mountains and show you everything.

291
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:22,458
And when you've seen everything, then you'll know what I meant with the bird.

292
00:22:22,944 --> 00:22:30,944
I promise you, you'll see it for sure. The flowers and the meadows and the grass
and the mountains.

293
00:22:30,944 --> 00:22:34,944
The mountains are so beautiful, you can't even imagine that.

294
00:22:34,944 --> 00:22:38,944
There are flowers and goats everywhere, their bells are ringing and the flowers
are smelling.

295
00:22:38,944 --> 00:22:41,944
And at the top of the mountain there's sometimes snow even in the summer.

296
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:45,944
Believe me, Clara, I'll take you to Dörfli and then to our island.

297
00:22:47,738 --> 00:22:55,738
Clara didn't know Heidi well enough to know that Heidi never forgot everything
she had in mind in life.

298
00:22:55,738 --> 00:23:01,738
And when Heidi promised her friend Clara to show her beloved mountains, she kept
that promise.

299
00:23:01,738 --> 00:23:05,738
And then one day she would show her the mountains.

300
00:23:05,738 --> 00:23:08,128
But there was still a long way to go.

301
00:23:08,128 --> 00:23:20,128
And Heidi still had many adventures to go on in the big city of Frankfurt, for
example the one with the little organ player from the corner of the house, which
she briefly invited to play Fräulein Rottenmeier.

302
00:23:20,128 --> 00:23:24,128
But we want to tell you about that in our next story.

303
00:23:24,582 --> 00:23:41,582
Heidi, Heidi, your world are the mountains, Heidi, Heidi, because up here you
are at home.

304
00:23:41,582 --> 00:23:53,582
Heidi, Heidi, come home, find your happiness, come back home.

305
00:23:54,582 --> 00:23:57,582
To be continued
