1
00:00:04,398 --> 00:00:09,398
Holadio

2
00:00:12,398 --> 00:00:17,398
Holadio

3
00:00:20,398 --> 00:00:24,398
Heidi, Heidi

4
00:00:24,398 --> 00:00:28,398
Your world are the mountains

5
00:00:28,398 --> 00:00:32,398
Heidi, Heidi

6
00:00:32,398 --> 00:00:36,398
Because up here you are at home

7
00:00:36,398 --> 00:00:40,398
Dark berries

8
00:00:40,398 --> 00:00:44,398
Green meadows in the sunshine

9
00:00:44,398 --> 00:00:48,398
Heidi, Heidi

10
00:00:48,398 --> 00:00:52,398
You need to be happy

11
00:00:52,398 --> 00:01:01,398
Holadio, Holadio, Holadio, Holadio, Holadio, Holadio, Holadio, Holadio, Holadio,
Holadio, Holadio, Holadio, Holadio, Holadio

12
00:01:01,398 --> 00:01:02,398
Holadio

13
00:01:02,398 --> 00:01:05,398
Jaijaijaijai, Holadio, Holadio

14
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:10,398
Heidi, Heidi

15
00:01:10,398 --> 00:01:12,398
Come home

16
00:01:12,398 --> 00:01:15,398
Find your happiness

17
00:01:15,398 --> 00:01:20,398
Come back home

18
00:01:32,398 --> 00:01:34,398
Look, kids, up there!

19
00:01:52,398 --> 00:01:55,398
Tell me, Clara, isn't the water like a mirror?

20
00:01:55,398 --> 00:01:56,858
Look closely!

21
00:01:56,858 --> 00:02:00,858
Heidi's right. It's a glass mirror made of pure silver paper.

22
00:02:02,858 --> 00:02:04,858
I don't know that one.

23
00:02:05,858 --> 00:02:09,858
Clara, Peter, Grandmother, hurry! There are flowers I haven't seen yet!

24
00:02:10,138 --> 00:02:11,138
I know them!

25
00:02:11,138 --> 00:02:14,138
They'll be here in a few minutes.

26
00:02:14,138 --> 00:02:16,138
I wish I could run as well as Heidi.

27
00:02:16,138 --> 00:02:18,138
It would be wonderful, Grandmother,

28
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,138
if I could run all the way up here on my own.

29
00:02:20,138 --> 00:02:22,138
You can do it if you want to.

30
00:02:22,138 --> 00:02:24,138
You just have to get up, as you know.

31
00:02:24,138 --> 00:02:26,138
Oh, what do I get out of trying it?

32
00:02:26,138 --> 00:02:29,138
It hurts, my legs aren't strong enough.

33
00:02:29,138 --> 00:02:30,138
It's all education.

34
00:02:30,138 --> 00:02:33,138
When you were afraid of the cow, you could do it.

35
00:02:33,138 --> 00:02:35,138
Clara, don't look so sad.

36
00:02:35,138 --> 00:02:37,138
I mean, it's not bad, even if it sounds like it.

37
00:02:37,138 --> 00:02:39,536
The next time you'll come all alone.

38
00:02:39,536 --> 00:02:42,536
I'll try. I hope you're right.

39
00:02:54,522 --> 00:02:58,522
That was a nice idea to climb up there with us. Maybe we can go again.

40
00:02:58,522 --> 00:03:00,522
Maybe next year, Clara.

41
00:03:00,522 --> 00:03:05,522
Now I'm going to the next best resort to recover from these exciting climbing
tours.

42
00:03:05,522 --> 00:03:07,449
I'm not the youngest anymore.

43
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:10,949
We will write to you regularly, then you know how I feel.

44
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:14,749
And as soon as you two have the news to report to me that I want to hear,

45
00:03:14,749 --> 00:03:18,449
I'll get on the next train and come to Braust.

46
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:23,449
Do you promise me to write at least one long letter every day?

47
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:24,949
Does it have to be every day?

48
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:25,949
Of course!

49
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:30,449
Can't you understand that I absolutely have to know if you've made any progress?

50
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:36,449
I like to write to you. Clara can teach me new words so that I can read better
what I'm scribbling together.

51
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:38,449
That's great! That's awesome!

52
00:03:38,857 --> 00:03:41,457
We're both going to write a letter every day.

53
00:03:41,457 --> 00:03:43,457
And when the letter I'm waiting for comes,

54
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:46,257
it's going to paint a thick red circle on the envelope.

55
00:03:46,257 --> 00:03:48,857
I'm going to tell the postman what it means.

56
00:03:48,857 --> 00:03:52,257
Then he can call from afar.

57
00:03:52,257 --> 00:03:55,957
Hopefully we can ever write that letter.

58
00:03:55,957 --> 00:03:58,157
You're going to write this letter, believe me.

59
00:03:58,157 --> 00:04:00,457
Yes, Grandmother.

60
00:04:00,457 --> 00:04:01,753
So, Almui.

61
00:04:01,753 --> 00:04:03,753
Please take good care of Clara.

62
00:04:03,753 --> 00:04:05,753
But you don't have to ask me for that.

63
00:04:05,753 --> 00:04:07,753
Then come back.

64
00:04:09,753 --> 00:04:11,753
Good thing you're back.

65
00:04:11,753 --> 00:04:13,753
Heidi!

66
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:14,753
Hurry up!

67
00:04:14,753 --> 00:04:16,753
Try to run with the whole herd.

68
00:04:16,753 --> 00:04:17,753
He will protect himself.

69
00:04:17,753 --> 00:04:19,753
Will something happen then?

70
00:04:19,753 --> 00:04:23,753
What do you think he should do to the goats when they pass him by?

71
00:04:23,753 --> 00:04:25,753
But what do you think of a farewell party?

72
00:04:25,753 --> 00:04:26,753
For you?

73
00:04:26,753 --> 00:04:28,753
No, for Peter.

74
00:04:28,753 --> 00:04:30,753
I would like to thank him for that.

75
00:04:31,545 --> 00:04:35,545
I have good news for you. You will get a farewell party.

76
00:04:35,545 --> 00:04:36,545
What is that?

77
00:04:36,545 --> 00:04:38,545
So you ask questions like a little child.

78
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:41,545
Well, I'm a little child too, aren't I?

79
00:04:41,545 --> 00:04:43,545
You, Clara!

80
00:04:43,545 --> 00:04:45,545
We shouldn't tell him how we imagine it.

81
00:04:45,545 --> 00:04:47,545
You rascal! What will you see tomorrow?

82
00:04:47,545 --> 00:04:49,545
It's a secret.

83
00:04:49,545 --> 00:04:50,545
A big one.

84
00:04:50,545 --> 00:04:53,545
There are no big secrets. There are only secret secrets.

85
00:04:53,545 --> 00:04:55,817
Doesn't matter. Come to our winter party tomorrow evening.

86
00:04:55,817 --> 00:04:57,817
Don't forget it.

87
00:04:57,817 --> 00:04:59,817
Is there something to eat tomorrow evening?

88
00:04:59,817 --> 00:05:01,817
Clara, you tell him.

89
00:05:01,817 --> 00:05:03,817
You can't know that now.

90
00:05:03,817 --> 00:05:05,817
Surprises have to surprise.

91
00:05:05,817 --> 00:05:07,817
Otherwise they are not surprises.

92
00:05:07,817 --> 00:05:09,817
Yes, if you think about it, you're right.

93
00:05:09,817 --> 00:05:11,817
You notice that you are very serious.

94
00:05:11,817 --> 00:05:13,817
Peter, don't you want to accompany us?

95
00:05:13,817 --> 00:05:15,817
Or do you plan to stay here for a while?

96
00:05:15,817 --> 00:05:17,817
No, too bad.

97
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,817
I have to go now.

98
00:05:19,817 --> 00:05:21,817
What about the surprise?

99
00:05:21,817 --> 00:05:23,817
I notice that.

100
00:05:23,817 --> 00:05:25,817
See you tomorrow evening.

101
00:05:25,817 --> 00:05:27,817
I also thought about it tomorrow.

102
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:32,091
that you wanted to come with us.

103
00:05:32,091 --> 00:05:33,091
This stupid head.

104
00:05:33,091 --> 00:05:34,091
Well.

105
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:37,091
Heidi and I will come down tomorrow morning and help you.

106
00:05:37,091 --> 00:05:39,091
Yes, but don't oversleep.

107
00:05:39,091 --> 00:05:41,091
I'm afraid that I won't sleep at all today because of excitement.

108
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,091
No, children.

109
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,091
Better come with Peter in the evening.

110
00:05:44,091 --> 00:05:45,091
What?

111
00:05:45,091 --> 00:05:47,091
You just said we should help you.

112
00:05:47,091 --> 00:05:48,091
Why?

113
00:05:48,091 --> 00:05:50,091
I just thought about it differently.

114
00:05:50,091 --> 00:05:52,091
Why should I actually just surprise Peter?

115
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:55,091
I would also like to prepare a surprise for you.

116
00:05:55,091 --> 00:05:57,091
Then it's much more fun.

117
00:05:57,091 --> 00:05:59,091
So, and what now?

118
00:05:59,091 --> 00:05:59,779
It's going to be fun.

119
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:05,779
Unfortunately, we can only wait. That's all. Good night, children. We'll see you
tomorrow evening. So, it can start.

120
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:10,779
See you tomorrow, children. Sleep well tonight, mom. I can hardly wait.

121
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:14,779
Good night. Goodbye.

122
00:06:28,812 --> 00:06:31,612
I'm curious what she came up with this time.

123
00:06:31,612 --> 00:06:33,612
Grandmother always has good ideas.

124
00:06:33,612 --> 00:06:35,612
Do you remember the wedding then?

125
00:06:35,612 --> 00:06:36,612
Yes, it was funny.

126
00:06:38,612 --> 00:06:40,212
You were a pretty bride.

127
00:06:40,212 --> 00:06:41,612
Yes, it was.

128
00:06:41,612 --> 00:06:45,212
We danced and then your grandmother slipped away.

129
00:06:45,212 --> 00:06:47,412
She was afraid to say goodbye to us.

130
00:06:47,412 --> 00:06:50,412
Yes, that's right. That's how it was.

131
00:06:51,012 --> 00:06:53,612
Did that make you sad to think about it?

132
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,660
Oh, if I knew it, I wouldn't have told you just now.

133
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:06,660
I just had to think that Grandmother is sitting somewhere nearby in a clinic and
is waiting for a very specific letter.

134
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,660
That's quite natural. Why not?

135
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,660
Clara, what is it?

136
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:17,660
Oh, what could it be? What do I do if I have to disappoint her and can't walk?

137
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:24,660
Stop it! You can walk quite well now, Clara. But if you don't practice, it'll
never get better. It's clear, isn't it?

138
00:07:24,962 --> 00:07:26,262
It's hard.

139
00:07:26,262 --> 00:07:28,762
It's easier than you think. Try it.

140
00:07:28,762 --> 00:07:31,962
You only have to practice every day. I'll help you with that.

141
00:07:33,262 --> 00:07:34,262
I'm scared.

142
00:07:34,262 --> 00:07:35,262
And why?

143
00:07:35,262 --> 00:07:37,962
That I'll try it and it won't work in the end.

144
00:07:37,962 --> 00:07:41,962
Yes, I can understand that. But it'll work in the end, believe me.

145
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:43,462
Hopefully.

146
00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:45,262
We'll start tomorrow.

147
00:07:46,062 --> 00:07:48,462
Promise me you'll join us, Clara.

148
00:07:48,462 --> 00:07:51,762
Good promise. But promise me you'll be patient.

149
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,462
Yes, of course.

150
00:07:54,962 --> 00:07:56,012
THE END

151
00:07:56,012 --> 00:08:00,012
I'll never believe in life that I can do it.

152
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:25,940
We're going to the pasture this morning and tonight together to the farewell
party of Grandmother.

153
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,940
Heidi, you two stay here today.

154
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,940
Why?

155
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,940
Clara should not overwork herself.

156
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,940
Both would be too much for her.

157
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,940
Besides, Clara has to start her walking exercises now.

158
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,940
Oh yes.

159
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,940
Better next week.

160
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:41,794
See you tomorrow, Clara.

161
00:08:41,794 --> 00:08:43,994
Can I watch while I'm studying?

162
00:08:43,994 --> 00:08:47,994
I can't imagine that Clara likes it. We should leave her alone.

163
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:48,994
Say something.

164
00:08:48,994 --> 00:08:51,794
What is it? Don't you want to go with the goats for a while today?

165
00:08:51,794 --> 00:08:53,794
And hurry up, today's a party.

166
00:08:53,794 --> 00:08:54,794
So it's on time.

167
00:08:54,794 --> 00:08:56,194
I am. Today, yes.

168
00:08:56,194 --> 00:08:57,794
So see you then.

169
00:08:57,794 --> 00:08:58,794
Good evening.

170
00:08:58,794 --> 00:09:00,394
We're supposed to practice today.

171
00:09:00,394 --> 00:09:03,394
We decided yesterday that we would practice today.

172
00:09:03,394 --> 00:09:06,394
No, tomorrow is early enough. Give her some time.

173
00:09:08,394 --> 00:09:11,394
So Clara, why do you have such a face again?

174
00:09:11,794 --> 00:09:12,315
I don't know.

175
00:09:12,315 --> 00:09:14,315
Because...

176
00:09:26,853 --> 00:09:28,853
You know what, Heidi?

177
00:09:28,853 --> 00:09:29,853
No, what?

178
00:09:29,853 --> 00:09:32,853
I feel like a baby has to practice running.

179
00:09:32,853 --> 00:09:36,853
I don't know, Clara. Sometimes I think you don't want to be able to run at all.

180
00:09:36,853 --> 00:09:38,853
You're always complaining about me.

181
00:09:38,853 --> 00:09:41,853
Now you have to be carried by other people all the time.

182
00:09:41,853 --> 00:09:44,853
Don't you feel like a baby at all?

183
00:09:44,853 --> 00:09:45,853
Yes, I do.

184
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:48,853
It's only starting to come to me now that you're saying it.

185
00:09:48,853 --> 00:09:50,853
Well, then stop complaining.

186
00:09:50,853 --> 00:09:53,853
We'll try it the way the grandfather said it before.

187
00:09:53,853 --> 00:09:55,853
Come on, don't be like that.

188
00:09:56,853 --> 00:09:57,349
Come on.

189
00:09:57,349 --> 00:10:02,349
So, now we want to see it.

190
00:10:02,349 --> 00:10:04,349
Does it hurt?

191
00:10:04,349 --> 00:10:06,349
Yes, a little bit.

192
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:16,733
And that? Did that hurt?

193
00:10:17,733 --> 00:10:18,733
Not at all.

194
00:10:18,733 --> 00:10:19,733
Well, then.

195
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:21,733
Just one try.

196
00:10:22,733 --> 00:10:24,733
Come on, just one.

197
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:27,733
Very slowly.

198
00:10:27,733 --> 00:10:28,733
Come on.

199
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:42,733
No, I can't. I'm scared.

200
00:10:42,733 --> 00:10:43,733
Heidi, let me go.

201
00:10:43,733 --> 00:10:45,733
Please, let me go.

202
00:10:45,733 --> 00:10:46,733
I can't.

203
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:52,533
I'm sorry. I thought it would be okay.

204
00:10:54,533 --> 00:10:56,533
Clara, does it still hurt?

205
00:10:56,533 --> 00:10:57,533
No.

206
00:10:57,533 --> 00:10:59,533
Just because I couldn't help enough.

207
00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:01,533
It won't be okay.

208
00:11:02,533 --> 00:11:04,533
I can't do it anymore. It's my fault.

209
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:07,533
Shall I get you a nice big glass of goat's milk?

210
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:08,533
Yes?

211
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:10,533
Yes, please. I can use that now.

212
00:11:13,533 --> 00:11:15,533
Sleep for a moment. I'll be right back.

213
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:17,533
And don't be sad.

214
00:11:18,533 --> 00:11:19,533
Don't be angry with me.

215
00:11:20,533 --> 00:11:21,533
I'll be right back.

216
00:11:26,789 --> 00:11:31,789
If only they would leave me alone. I can't do it anymore.

217
00:11:44,165 --> 00:11:46,165
Now I feel better.

218
00:11:46,165 --> 00:11:51,165
Then it's good. Let's try again. I know what I did wrong before.

219
00:11:51,165 --> 00:11:56,165
No, not today. Your grandfather said we'll start tomorrow.

220
00:11:56,165 --> 00:11:58,165
Yes, I know. One try. Come on.

221
00:11:58,165 --> 00:11:59,165
No, let go.

222
00:11:59,165 --> 00:12:04,165
Tell me, aren't you curious what Grandmother thought of as a surprise?

223
00:12:04,165 --> 00:12:07,165
No. You only ask because you want to distract.

224
00:12:07,165 --> 00:12:09,165
Clara, one more try.

225
00:12:09,165 --> 00:12:09,940
Oh.

226
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,440
Now, finally, stop.

227
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,940
Okay, I'll stop. But it's still so long until tonight.

228
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,940
The sun hasn't set yet.

229
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,940
I just can't wait any longer.

230
00:12:30,654 --> 00:12:34,654
It probably doesn't want to get dark at all today, stupid.

231
00:12:36,654 --> 00:12:39,654
Well, then I'll give Geißlein some herbs.

232
00:12:39,654 --> 00:12:41,654
It stinks boring without the others.

233
00:12:41,654 --> 00:12:43,654
Geißlein!

234
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:46,266
Geißlein!

235
00:13:14,266 --> 00:13:24,266
Why are you so late? We ran away with a stupid goat. I have to find her.

236
00:13:24,266 --> 00:13:29,266
Clara, Peter came back with the goats.

237
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:33,054
You're late. I know.

238
00:13:33,054 --> 00:13:35,054
Yes, Geißler ran away.

239
00:13:35,054 --> 00:13:36,054
I see.

240
00:13:36,054 --> 00:13:37,054
Did she get lost?

241
00:13:37,054 --> 00:13:38,054
Yes.

242
00:13:38,054 --> 00:13:39,054
Come on.

243
00:13:39,054 --> 00:13:41,054
You have to stay alone today.

244
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:42,054
We can.

245
00:13:43,054 --> 00:13:44,054
Finally.

246
00:14:03,054 --> 00:14:04,054
Oh, there.

247
00:14:04,054 --> 00:14:05,054
The one from the island.

248
00:14:05,054 --> 00:14:06,054
Oh, there.

249
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:07,054
The one from the island.

250
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,690
It must be the little girl from the city who is wearing that.

251
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:10,390
Peter?

252
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,090
Yes?

253
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:12,590
Oh, nothing.

254
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,590
Good evening, how are you?

255
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,890
Thank you, Heidi. Good.

256
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:15,890
Except for my Rheuma.

257
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,190
Oh, hello.

258
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:19,590
Good evening.

259
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:24,190
Let's see if Barribbel knows what they are all looking for together down here.

260
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,690
Do you know if there is a special reason?

261
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,190
What should have a reason?

262
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:31,290
The old woman from Frankfurt has sent all kinds of people to villages

263
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,890
and made a huge theater.

264
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,490
The grandmother?

265
00:14:34,868 --> 00:14:37,468
She's organising a party for me tonight. 她今天晚上为我举行了一场庆祝。

266
00:14:37,468 --> 00:14:38,168
I don't think so. 没想到。

267
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:39,568
Give it to her again, will you? 再给她一次,是吗?

268
00:14:40,368 --> 00:14:42,668
But a party could be something like that. 但是一场庆祝可以是什么呢?

269
00:14:45,068 --> 00:14:47,268
Come on, you're invited to join them. 来吧,你被他们邀请了。

270
00:14:47,268 --> 00:14:49,568
I'll distribute the goats for you. Go ahead. 我会给你们分配的,你去吧。

271
00:14:49,568 --> 00:14:50,968
Thank you. Thank you so much. 谢谢,谢谢。

272
00:14:50,968 --> 00:14:53,568
You, Peter, tell me tomorrow, okay? 你,Peter,告诉我明天,好吗?

273
00:14:54,068 --> 00:14:56,668
I'd love to know why she bought all of this. 我想知道她买了这些东西的原因。

274
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:03,879
Where are you going? What is it?

275
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:05,879
To the children!

276
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:07,879
What are you doing here?

277
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:09,879
What is she doing there?

278
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:10,879
Who is doing what?

279
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:11,879
There!

280
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:12,879
A party?

281
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,879
That can't be! Look at this!

282
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:19,879
Peter! Clara!

283
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,879
Come on, Grandfather! Look at this!

284
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,879
What are you doing?

285
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:27,879
How beautiful it looks! A party! A real lampio party!

286
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:32,599
To be continued

287
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:35,599
And all the circumstances just for me.

288
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:38,599
Oh, you're coming just in time. The food is ready.

289
00:15:38,599 --> 00:15:40,599
Play on, musicians!

290
00:15:54,455 --> 00:15:57,375
Please step in, children, and take a seat.

291
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,375
Come on, Grandfather, let's go.

292
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,375
Simply wonderful.

293
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,375
Very wonderful.

294
00:16:14,743 --> 00:16:17,743
Oh, welcome, Alm-Öhi.

295
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:19,743
Thank you very much for the invitation.

296
00:16:19,743 --> 00:16:23,743
That's good. He thanks you for the invitation, but it's his house.

297
00:16:23,743 --> 00:16:25,743
Yes, you're right.

298
00:16:26,743 --> 00:16:30,743
Grandmother, are the children allowed to come in and look at everything?

299
00:16:30,743 --> 00:16:32,743
I'm going with them to a class.

300
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:34,743
There's enough food for everyone.

301
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:38,743
Go and tell them that they are all warmly invited.

302
00:16:40,743 --> 00:16:43,743
You are allowed to come in. You are invited.

303
00:16:44,743 --> 00:16:47,511
Thank you.

304
00:16:48,471 --> 00:16:50,271
Do you look so good? Is it comfortable?

305
00:16:50,271 --> 00:16:52,511
Yes, thank you very much. It's all good like that.

306
00:16:53,511 --> 00:16:57,551
Grandmother, you always have the best ideas. It's just wonderful.

307
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:02,111
Grandmother, these are my classmates.

308
00:17:02,111 --> 00:17:06,991
Jakob, Klaus-Jürgen, Liselotte, Peter the Second, the long Oskar, and this?

309
00:17:08,831 --> 00:17:10,351
Who is this?

310
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,111
This is the daughter of my oldest sister.

311
00:17:15,911 --> 00:17:17,151
Then you're her uncle.

312
00:17:17,511 --> 00:17:18,013
Yes, that's right.

313
00:17:18,013 --> 00:17:22,573
You've got more friends than I thought. I think I need to have more bread ready.

314
00:17:22,573 --> 00:17:25,213
The sausages probably won't be enough either.

315
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:28,213
Here, the first floor.

316
00:17:29,573 --> 00:17:32,213
Heidi, look what she's doing there.

317
00:17:45,073 --> 00:17:46,133
I've got you!

318
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:48,133
Come on, let's play catch!

319
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:52,133
You're up, you're up, you're up, you're up, you're up, you're up!

320
00:17:52,133 --> 00:17:53,133
Yes!

321
00:17:53,133 --> 00:17:54,133
Watch out, Peter!

322
00:17:54,133 --> 00:17:56,133
No! No!

323
00:17:56,133 --> 00:17:59,024
I got you! Stay here! No, faster!

324
00:18:01,436 --> 00:18:03,436
Ha! Ha! Ha!

325
00:18:09,436 --> 00:18:12,436
Here we are! You're running yourself, you fool!

326
00:18:16,436 --> 00:18:18,436
Here I am! Here I am!

327
00:18:20,436 --> 00:18:23,436
Don't go up there! But I'll get you too! Just wait!

328
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,436
Do you have to run after me all the time?

329
00:18:26,436 --> 00:18:28,436
Find someone else!

330
00:18:31,436 --> 00:18:33,436
Aha! You're the one!

331
00:18:33,936 --> 00:18:35,936
It's our turn!

332
00:18:40,936 --> 00:18:42,936
We call the game running after.

333
00:18:42,936 --> 00:18:44,936
Don't you want to join us?

334
00:18:44,936 --> 00:18:46,936
Oh, yes.

335
00:18:46,936 --> 00:18:48,936
A relaxed band.

336
00:18:48,936 --> 00:18:50,936
I used to be like that, too.

337
00:19:03,936 --> 00:19:05,936
It's your turn!

338
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,936
That's the way it is when you don't pay attention for a moment.

339
00:19:08,936 --> 00:19:10,096
Let's try it.

340
00:19:10,096 --> 00:19:12,096
Not tonight.

341
00:19:12,096 --> 00:19:14,096
Good night.

342
00:19:29,096 --> 00:19:31,096
Here I am! Here I am!

343
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,920
That's how it has to be. That's how it should be for you too.

344
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,920
Yes.

345
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,920
And that's how it will be for you too when you practice hard.

346
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,920
Yes, maybe.

347
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,920
For sure you have to want it.

348
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,920
With all your heart.

349
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,920
You can run, Clara. You have already proven it to us.

350
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,920
You have to practice hard.

351
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,920
Do you think that helps?

352
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,920
Yes, that helps you.

353
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,920
But you have to wish it, my child.

354
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,920
You can't think of anything else.

355
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,798
You can do it.

356
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:04,798
Let's believe it, Clara. You can do it.

357
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:09,798
You must never give up on believing that you will be able to do it one day.

358
00:20:09,798 --> 00:20:11,798
Please promise me that, Clara.

359
00:20:11,798 --> 00:20:13,798
I promise it to you.

360
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:17,798
Then let's start practicing tomorrow morning, okay?

361
00:20:17,798 --> 00:20:19,798
Yes.

362
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:23,798
We won! We won! We won!

363
00:20:24,784 --> 00:20:27,784
If you sit there, everyone will come to the table.

364
00:20:27,784 --> 00:20:29,784
It's the last one!

365
00:20:45,784 --> 00:20:46,928
I fell on it.

366
00:20:46,928 --> 00:20:48,928
It has to be eaten up!

367
00:20:48,928 --> 00:20:50,928
It won't stay crunchy!

368
00:20:52,928 --> 00:20:54,928
Hey, leave something else!

369
00:21:11,401 --> 00:21:24,401
Good morning, you are so quiet in the evening clouds.

370
00:21:24,401 --> 00:21:34,401
You are so quiet without feeling that I am without peace.

371
00:21:41,401 --> 00:21:43,369
Write to us too, big mama.

372
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:47,769
But yes, Clara, of course I'll write to you right away when I get there.

373
00:21:48,869 --> 00:21:50,569
Grandmother, I'll try.

374
00:21:50,569 --> 00:21:53,169
I'll wait for a message every day.

375
00:21:53,169 --> 00:21:54,769
I know she'll come.

376
00:21:54,769 --> 00:21:56,469
Yes, I think so too.

377
00:21:56,469 --> 00:21:58,769
Goodbye, Heidi. Help her.

378
00:21:58,769 --> 00:22:00,969
Goodbye and thank you.

379
00:22:00,969 --> 00:22:02,669
Thank you very much, Almö.

380
00:22:02,969 --> 00:22:04,369
Goodbye.

381
00:22:05,369 --> 00:22:07,069
Somehow a pity.

382
00:22:13,369 --> 00:22:17,769
To be continued...

383
00:22:17,801 --> 00:22:20,401
Goodbye, Grandmother. I will write to you.

384
00:22:20,401 --> 00:22:23,301
I know that I can walk. I can walk.

385
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:27,301
I can walk. I know it. I can walk.

386
00:22:27,301 --> 00:22:29,801
I will write to you.

387
00:22:47,801 --> 00:22:49,129
I can walk. I can walk.

388
00:22:49,129 --> 00:22:55,129
Right the next morning, Heidi and Clara made the promise to always practice
hard.

389
00:22:55,129 --> 00:23:00,129
They practiced every day and very slowly they could notice a slight improvement.

390
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:07,129
Peter was of course the most impatient of all. He just didn't want to wait until
Clara was finally healthy.

391
00:23:07,129 --> 00:23:14,959
But until that was the case, Clara, Heidi and her grandfather had to work hard
for many, many hours.

392
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:19,959
And then suddenly a letter came from the grandmother who made Clara very, very
sad.

393
00:23:19,959 --> 00:23:23,959
But we want to tell you about that in our next story.

394
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:35,333
Heidi, Heidi, your world are the mountains.

395
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:43,333
Heidi, Heidi, because up here you are at home.

396
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:56,333
Heidi, Heidi, come home, find your happiness, come back home.
