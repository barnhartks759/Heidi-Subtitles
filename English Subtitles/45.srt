00:00:02,406 --> 00:00:17,406
Holadio

2
00:00:20,406 --> 00:00:24,406
Heidi, Heidi

3
00:00:24,406 --> 00:00:28,406
Your world are the mountains

4
00:00:28,406 --> 00:00:32,406
Heidi, Heidi

5
00:00:32,406 --> 00:00:36,406
Because up here you are at home

6
00:00:36,406 --> 00:00:40,406
Dark firs

7
00:00:40,406 --> 00:00:44,406
Green meadows in the sunshine

8
00:00:44,406 --> 00:00:48,406
Heidi, Heidi

9
00:00:48,406 --> 00:00:52,406
You need to be happy

10
00:00:52,406 --> 00:00:54,406
Holadio, Holadio

11
00:00:54,406 --> 00:00:56,406
Heidi, Heidi

12
00:00:56,406 --> 00:00:58,406
Holadio, Holadio

13
00:00:58,406 --> 00:01:00,406
Holadio, Holadio

14
00:01:00,406 --> 00:01:02,406
Holadio, Holadio

15
00:01:02,406 --> 00:01:04,406
Holadio, Holadio

16
00:01:04,406 --> 00:01:06,406
Holadio

17
00:01:06,406 --> 00:01:10,406
Heidi, Heidi

18
00:01:10,406 --> 00:01:12,406
Come home

19
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,406
Find your happiness

20
00:01:14,406 --> 00:01:18,406
Come back home

21
00:01:28,406 --> 00:01:40,406
You

22
00:01:40,406 --> 00:01:42,406
Heidi, Heidi

23
00:01:44,282 --> 00:01:48,282
Now I've fallen asleep again. Heidi!

24
00:01:49,282 --> 00:01:51,282
Heidi?

25
00:01:52,794 --> 00:01:59,794
Yes, you long-sleeper. Good morning. Where is Heidi? They stormed out of the
house early in the morning.

26
00:01:59,794 --> 00:02:05,794
Yes? Where did she go? No idea. She didn't tell me anything. Come on, let's have
breakfast.

27
00:02:21,498 --> 00:02:23,498
Heidi?

28
00:02:23,498 --> 00:02:25,498
Good morning, Brigitte!

29
00:02:25,498 --> 00:02:28,498
Yes, what do you want down here with us?

30
00:02:28,498 --> 00:02:30,498
You're as fast as the fire brigade.

31
00:02:30,498 --> 00:02:32,498
Did something happen?

32
00:02:32,498 --> 00:02:34,498
Will you do me a favor, Brigitte?

33
00:02:34,498 --> 00:02:36,498
Can you lend me some old pants from Peter?

34
00:02:36,498 --> 00:02:38,498
That's why you ran away like that.

35
00:02:38,498 --> 00:02:39,498
Mhm.

36
00:02:39,498 --> 00:02:42,498
The good one he wears. I only have an old one stuffed here.

37
00:02:42,498 --> 00:02:44,498
That's enough. I don't need a good one.

38
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:48,498
If you think so, I still want to know what you're up to.

39
00:02:48,498 --> 00:02:50,498
I'll explain it later.

40
00:02:51,498 --> 00:02:53,498
Haha!

41
00:03:09,054 --> 00:03:13,554
Here, this is the only one we still have. You don't want to put it on, do you?

42
00:03:13,554 --> 00:03:14,554
I don't!

43
00:03:14,554 --> 00:03:15,554
Who else?

44
00:03:15,554 --> 00:03:16,554
Thank you!

45
00:03:17,554 --> 00:03:19,554
Give it to Peter later!

46
00:03:19,554 --> 00:03:20,554
Yes!

47
00:03:25,822 --> 00:03:27,822
Thank you very much.

48
00:03:29,822 --> 00:03:31,822
Wasn't that Heidi?

49
00:03:31,822 --> 00:03:33,822
What did she want so early down here with us, Brigitte?

50
00:03:33,822 --> 00:03:36,822
She borrowed some old trousers from Peter.

51
00:03:36,822 --> 00:03:38,822
I just want to know what she needs them for.

52
00:03:38,822 --> 00:03:40,822
I'd like to know that too.

53
00:03:40,822 --> 00:03:43,822
Surely our Peter has torn his new trousers

54
00:03:43,822 --> 00:03:46,822
and now he's afraid to come home.

55
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,590
Now I just have to talk to Clara about it.

56
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,590
Good morning, Clara!

57
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,590
Where have you been so early?

58
00:04:18,366 --> 00:04:20,366
I got something for you.

59
00:04:20,366 --> 00:04:22,366
What is it?

60
00:04:22,366 --> 00:04:24,366
Please put it on, yes?

61
00:04:24,366 --> 00:04:26,366
I think it would fit you exactly.

62
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:28,366
Why should I put it on?

63
00:04:28,366 --> 00:04:30,366
I already put on a dress.

64
00:04:30,366 --> 00:04:32,366
A dress, but no pants.

65
00:04:32,366 --> 00:04:34,366
Now I don't understand anything anymore.

66
00:04:34,366 --> 00:04:36,366
You don't have to do that.

67
00:04:36,366 --> 00:04:38,366
Just put on your pants.

68
00:04:38,366 --> 00:04:40,366
My pants? I can't possibly put on a pants.

69
00:04:40,366 --> 00:04:42,366
And if you can?

70
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,366
Where is your wheelchair?

71
00:04:44,804 --> 00:04:46,804
Where were you?

72
00:04:46,804 --> 00:04:48,804
Downstairs with Brigitte. I borrowed something.

73
00:04:48,804 --> 00:04:51,804
Heidi wants me to put on pants, but that's not possible.

74
00:04:51,804 --> 00:04:53,804
And she doesn't say why.

75
00:04:53,804 --> 00:04:54,804
Yes.

76
00:04:54,804 --> 00:04:56,804
That's something new. What did you screw on the wheelchair?

77
00:04:56,804 --> 00:04:58,804
I would like to know that too.

78
00:04:58,804 --> 00:05:00,804
What could that be? Think about it.

79
00:05:00,804 --> 00:05:03,804
I have no idea. It doesn't even look nice yet.

80
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:07,804
Grandfather, now tell me what's good about it.

81
00:05:07,804 --> 00:05:09,804
I'll show you. Push the wheelchair.

82
00:05:09,804 --> 00:05:11,804
Yes gladly.

83
00:05:14,302 --> 00:05:17,302
Lara, pull the lever now.

84
00:05:17,302 --> 00:05:19,302
This one?

85
00:05:19,302 --> 00:05:21,302
Ouch!

86
00:05:21,302 --> 00:05:23,302
Now it's rolling again.

87
00:05:23,302 --> 00:05:24,302
Weird.

88
00:05:24,302 --> 00:05:27,302
Now I understand. That way I can slow down the wheelchair.

89
00:05:27,302 --> 00:05:30,302
Now it's at least less dangerous for you.

90
00:05:30,302 --> 00:05:32,302
I hope it helps you, Lara.

91
00:05:32,302 --> 00:05:33,302
Yes, thank you very much.

92
00:05:33,302 --> 00:05:35,302
Now you don't have to hold the wheels with your hand all the time.

93
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:37,302
Thank you, Grandfather.

94
00:05:37,302 --> 00:05:39,302
You're welcome, my child.

95
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,620
So, Heidi, now tell me what you're up to with these pants.

96
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,620
Clara, she's supposed to put them on. I've already told you.

97
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,620
So? Why?

98
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,620
You'll see why she's supposed to.

99
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,620
Why are you making it so secretive?

100
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,620
Just like that. Clara, here, put them on.

101
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,620
Clara!

102
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,620
Clara!

103
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,620
Put the brakes on!

104
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,620
Clara, put them on!

105
00:06:12,482 --> 00:06:15,482
You think that's very strange. Did it have to be?

106
00:06:15,482 --> 00:06:17,482
What's wrong with you? There's the brake.

107
00:06:17,482 --> 00:06:19,482
Yes, that's right. You're somehow right.

108
00:06:19,482 --> 00:06:20,482
But it wasn't good anyway.

109
00:06:20,482 --> 00:06:23,482
Don't be like that. What can happen? I can stop now.

110
00:06:23,482 --> 00:06:24,482
Calm down.

111
00:06:24,482 --> 00:06:28,482
Yes, it's all right. I was just scared.

112
00:06:33,922 --> 00:06:37,922
Tomorrow, Peggy. Are you still waiting for a goat?

113
00:06:38,922 --> 00:06:39,922
Yes.

114
00:06:51,922 --> 00:06:53,602
I can't believe it.

115
00:06:53,602 --> 00:06:58,602
I can't do it and I don't want to. After all, I'm not a climber and I don't stay
here all night.

116
00:06:58,602 --> 00:07:01,602
Oh, who wants something now?

117
00:07:03,602 --> 00:07:04,602
What do you want, Peter?

118
00:07:04,602 --> 00:07:06,602
The goats are slowly becoming impatient.

119
00:07:06,602 --> 00:07:08,602
Get rid of this unnecessary animal stuff.

120
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:10,602
That's not possible. But when are you coming?

121
00:07:10,602 --> 00:07:16,602
Later. How many times should I tell you that I don't want to be spoiled by you?

122
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,602
Oh, I always forget that.

123
00:07:18,602 --> 00:07:21,602
I'll let a farmer help me today. Thank you.

124
00:07:21,602 --> 00:07:22,602
Please.

125
00:07:23,384 --> 00:07:27,384
You let her stand with the goats in the landscape for an hour and don't say a
word.

126
00:07:27,384 --> 00:07:30,384
But you should say, but I'm going to get her.

127
00:07:46,946 --> 00:07:48,946
Today he's coming so late.

128
00:07:48,946 --> 00:07:50,946
You can't rely on him.

129
00:07:50,946 --> 00:07:52,946
If you're in a hurry, something will happen to him.

130
00:07:52,946 --> 00:07:54,946
That's how he is.

131
00:07:54,946 --> 00:07:56,946
Who's in a hurry? We have the whole day.

132
00:07:56,946 --> 00:07:58,946
No, I have something planned.

133
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:00,946
There, he's coming!

134
00:08:00,946 --> 00:08:02,946
Finally! Now let's go!

135
00:08:02,946 --> 00:08:04,946
Morning!

136
00:08:04,946 --> 00:08:06,946
It's about time.

137
00:08:06,946 --> 00:08:08,946
Good morning. Where is Mrs. Rottenmeier?

138
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:10,946
Down in the village and she's complaining.

139
00:08:10,946 --> 00:08:12,946
Why? I have no idea.

140
00:08:12,946 --> 00:08:14,712
She's in a terrible mood.

141
00:08:14,712 --> 00:08:18,712
Wonderful, then she's not here today and everything will work out as planned.

142
00:08:18,712 --> 00:08:20,712
Do you know what she has today?

143
00:08:20,712 --> 00:08:22,712
What do you have today, Heidi?

144
00:08:22,712 --> 00:08:24,712
You know it.

145
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,712
Yes, that's right.

146
00:08:26,712 --> 00:08:28,712
I don't know what she has today either.

147
00:08:28,712 --> 00:08:31,712
And now tell her to put on your pants.

148
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:33,712
No, I can't do that.

149
00:08:33,712 --> 00:08:38,712
I'm a girl, it just doesn't belong and it looks impossible.

150
00:08:38,712 --> 00:08:42,712
Tell her right away that it doesn't look impossible. Go on, please.

151
00:08:43,576 --> 00:08:50,576
Clara, Heidi means... No, I mean... Yes, you know... Yes, just like that.

152
00:08:50,576 --> 00:08:55,576
Clara, didn't I tell you yesterday that we wanted to go to the flower garden?

153
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,576
Oh, that's why!

154
00:08:57,576 --> 00:08:59,576
What do you mean?

155
00:08:59,576 --> 00:09:02,576
Just like I told you. Peter will carry you on his back.

156
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:06,576
Yes, you said that, but I'm way too heavy.

157
00:09:06,576 --> 00:09:08,092
It will be fine.

158
00:09:08,092 --> 00:09:12,692
Am I not too heavy for you, Peter? Oh, if you could take me with you, that would
be wonderful.

159
00:09:12,692 --> 00:09:14,492
Yes, that would be it.

160
00:09:14,492 --> 00:09:16,892
I also make myself very light.

161
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,892
Thank you, Peter, that's nice of you.

162
00:09:23,192 --> 00:09:25,892
And now the pants are being put on.

163
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,866
Peter, we're done!

164
00:09:28,866 --> 00:09:30,866
Yes? Great!

165
00:09:56,866 --> 00:10:01,866
It can start now.

166
00:10:02,566 --> 00:10:04,566
Yes, it looks strange.

167
00:10:04,566 --> 00:10:08,366
No one sees you, and Mrs. Rottenmeier I hold here firmly.

168
00:10:08,366 --> 00:10:09,066
Mhm.

169
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:11,566
Hopefully you have not taken too much.

170
00:10:11,566 --> 00:10:13,066
Oh, it's going to be fine.

171
00:10:13,066 --> 00:10:14,066
I'll get it done.

172
00:10:14,066 --> 00:10:14,566
Come on, Clara.

173
00:10:14,566 --> 00:10:15,566
Hold on tight.

174
00:10:15,566 --> 00:10:17,066
Don't drop it.

175
00:10:17,066 --> 00:10:18,066
Is it okay?

176
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:19,566
Yes, better than I thought.

177
00:10:23,366 --> 00:10:24,366
Come on.

178
00:10:24,366 --> 00:10:25,566
Will it be okay, Clara?

179
00:10:25,566 --> 00:10:26,866
Do you feel safe?

180
00:10:26,866 --> 00:10:28,566
Yes, it's very comfortable.

181
00:10:28,566 --> 00:10:30,066
Have fun, children.

182
00:10:30,316 --> 00:10:35,916
Peter, take good care of where you go and don't come home too late today, okay?

183
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:38,516
Yes, I know. Goodbye.

184
00:10:38,516 --> 00:10:40,416
Come on, Heidi, you carry the backpack.

185
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:41,716
Yes.

186
00:10:41,716 --> 00:10:43,916
Everything will be eaten up, do you hear?

187
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,516
I can do that easily.

188
00:10:45,516 --> 00:10:48,516
I didn't expect that from you in any other moment.

189
00:10:48,516 --> 00:10:52,016
Please leave something for the others too. Especially Clara has to eat.

190
00:10:52,016 --> 00:10:54,516
I will. What do they think of me?

191
00:10:54,652 --> 00:10:59,152
And you, Clara, close your eyes wide open and look at everything carefully.

192
00:10:59,152 --> 00:11:02,152
Yes, of course, you don't have to tell me that.

193
00:11:06,152 --> 00:11:11,152
Go on, Joseph, go with the children and help Peter to pick up the goats.

194
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,550
Don't overwork yourself!

195
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,550
Definitely not! No!

196

197
00:12:04,362 --> 00:12:08,362
Can't you sit down and take a break?

198
00:12:08,362 --> 00:12:12,362
I planned it and will do it. No break.

199
00:12:12,362 --> 00:12:14,362
Careful.

200
00:12:27,434 --> 00:12:29,434
Uli, please let me down.

201
00:12:29,434 --> 00:12:31,434
I won't let you down.

202
00:12:42,434 --> 00:12:44,434
So this is your pasture.

203
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,650
That's how you described it. Oh, look over there!

204
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,650
Those are marmots.

205
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:53,650
That's how they look, so cute.

206
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,650
They'll stay there for a long time today.

207
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,650
You're lucky, otherwise they'll disappear much faster.

208
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:01,650
There, gone, like swallowed up by the earth.

209
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,650
Let's stay here, okay? There are enough flowers for us.

210
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,650
Oh, what? Peter's carrying you. He's strong.

211
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,650
Oh, what? We want to go a little higher.

212
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,650
We'll be there soon.

213
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,650
Well, good luck.

214
00:13:13,984 --> 00:13:16,784
He needs that too.

215
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:32,790
Oh, we're here.

216
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:41,790
Just wonderful.

217
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,790
Yes.

218
00:13:42,790 --> 00:14:00,790
Yes.

219
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:06,790
Get up.

220
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,790
Listen to the flowers.

221
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,790
There are so many.

222
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,790
It's like a fairy tale.

223
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,790
Yes.

224
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,790
We're finally here.

225
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,790
Millions of flowers.

226
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:18,790
Yes.

227
00:14:19,754 --> 00:14:25,754
As far as you can see, it's so wonderful that I just can't believe it. Just
fantastic!

228
00:14:26,754 --> 00:14:31,754
I'm picking my bouquet back there on the rock. You can pick it here.

229
00:14:37,754 --> 00:14:39,754
If they don't come back...

230
00:14:39,786 --> 00:14:42,786
What if she forgets me?

231
00:14:42,786 --> 00:14:47,786
Oh, come on, Heidi, she'll come back for sure.

232
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:52,786
Oh, if I could run and jump and dance like Heidi. That must be nice.

233
00:14:59,342 --> 00:15:02,342
I find that irresponsible of you.

234
00:15:03,342 --> 00:15:06,342
How can you leave the children alone on the flower meadow?

235
00:15:08,342 --> 00:15:11,342
Who knows where this strange flower meadow is?

236
00:15:11,342 --> 00:15:14,342
Who guarantees that the children do not get lost?

237
00:15:15,342 --> 00:15:21,342
Tell me, have you ever thought that you could go on the nerves of people with
your constant whining?

238
00:15:21,342 --> 00:15:26,342
No, not yet. And I am convinced that intelligent people take my warnings
seriously.

239
00:15:26,852 --> 00:15:28,852
I fear the worst for Clara.

240
00:15:32,352 --> 00:15:35,852
You see, that's the difference. I think it's good for you.

241
00:15:38,352 --> 00:15:41,352
I don't know if you really appreciate Clara's situation.

242
00:15:41,352 --> 00:15:44,352
Clara is different. You can't compare her to other children.

243
00:15:44,352 --> 00:15:47,352
But you don't want to listen to me. You don't want to see it.

244
00:15:47,352 --> 00:15:49,852
Why don't you make yourself a cup of coffee?

245
00:15:49,852 --> 00:15:51,852
I can't believe it.

246
00:15:51,852 --> 00:15:53,852
There's fresh milk, too.

247
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:55,852
I don't like goat milk.

248
00:15:56,852 --> 00:15:57,454
I don't like it either.

249
00:15:57,454 --> 00:16:02,454
Clara is here so that she can feel the desire to finally stand on her own two
feet.

250
00:16:02,454 --> 00:16:05,454
This is what the secret is based on, and I also have great hopes.

251
00:16:05,454 --> 00:16:08,454
Get that out of your head. Clara will never be able to walk.

252
00:16:08,454 --> 00:16:10,454
And I tell you, she will.

253
00:16:12,454 --> 00:16:16,454
Clara was surrounded by you and the servants from morning to evening.

254
00:16:16,454 --> 00:16:20,454
Every day she was told that she was sick and could not walk.

255
00:16:20,454 --> 00:16:22,454
Have you ever given her courage?

256
00:16:22,454 --> 00:16:23,454
Oh!

257
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:30,454
To be continued

258
00:16:32,334 --> 00:16:34,334
Watch out! I'm going to eat.

259
00:16:34,334 --> 00:16:36,334
Thanks!

260
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:48,606
Oh, a tablecloth made of flowers.

261
00:16:48,606 --> 00:16:49,606
Yes.

262
00:16:50,606 --> 00:16:51,606
It's festive.

263
00:16:53,606 --> 00:16:56,606
Fresh goat milk can't be found anywhere else.

264
00:16:56,606 --> 00:16:57,606
Yes.

265
00:16:58,606 --> 00:16:59,606
Where's Peter's bowl?

266
00:16:59,606 --> 00:17:01,606
Peter doesn't need any.

267
00:17:01,606 --> 00:17:02,606
Why?

268
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,606
Just wait, you'll see.

269
00:17:09,606 --> 00:17:10,606
Don't look like that.

270
00:17:11,172 --> 00:17:13,172
You look like you saw a ghost.

271
00:17:13,172 --> 00:17:16,672
Can't you really imagine how Peter would do that?

272
00:17:16,672 --> 00:17:19,672
No, unfortunately not. But now I'll see for myself.

273
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:21,172
You have to eat first, I'm starving!

274
00:17:21,172 --> 00:17:22,172
The bread is smeared.

275
00:17:22,172 --> 00:17:23,672
And where the milk is, you know.

276
00:17:23,672 --> 00:17:25,172
You can say that.

277
00:17:32,672 --> 00:17:34,172
Well, do you know now?

278
00:17:41,172 --> 00:17:44,172

279
00:17:50,734 --> 00:17:53,934
I don't know. I don't know. I don't make such accusations.

280
00:17:53,934 --> 00:17:56,734
You should actually be the one making the accusations.

281
00:17:56,734 --> 00:18:00,734
None of us has any reason to think of accusations at all.

282

283
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,938
Do you want to take a break, Peter?

284
00:18:31,338 --> 00:18:32,338
Careful!

285
00:18:33,338 --> 00:18:33,842
Clara has...

286
00:18:33,842 --> 00:18:35,842
Let's take a break.

287
00:18:35,842 --> 00:18:38,842
We don't have time. We promised to be home on time.

288
00:18:44,178 --> 00:18:46,178
Did you get hurt somewhere?

289
00:18:46,178 --> 00:18:47,178
Not a bit, really not.

290
00:18:47,178 --> 00:18:49,178
Wait, I'll get the Grandfather!

291
00:18:49,178 --> 00:18:51,178
No, you don't need that!

292
00:18:54,706 --> 00:18:59,706
Let's wait for the grandfather. It's not far anymore. He'll come and help us.

293
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:03,706
You've really done enough today. I'm way too heavy.

294
00:19:03,706 --> 00:19:06,706
Fine by me, but I would have made it.

295
00:19:21,074 --> 00:19:25,074
I can only see and smell the goats. I can't find the children anywhere.

296
00:19:27,074 --> 00:19:29,074
Grandfather!

297
00:19:30,074 --> 00:19:31,058
Stay here!

298
00:19:31,058 --> 00:19:33,058
Heidi, quick! What happened?

299
00:19:33,058 --> 00:19:35,058
Grandfather!

300
00:19:35,058 --> 00:19:37,058
Imagine, Peter has...

301
00:19:37,058 --> 00:19:39,058
Peter has...

302
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:41,058
What's wrong with him, Peter? Is he hurt?

303
00:19:41,058 --> 00:19:43,058
Speak up!

304
00:19:47,058 --> 00:19:49,058
Why didn't you wait?

305
00:19:49,058 --> 00:19:51,058
Mrs. Clara!

306
00:19:54,058 --> 00:19:56,058
You should have waited!

307
00:19:56,058 --> 00:19:58,058
You're a fathead!

308
00:19:58,058 --> 00:20:00,050
Are you alright?

309
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:02,050
Of course. We're back.

310
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:04,050
Yes, we're back.

311
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,050
Very good, Peter. Great.

312
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,050
I think so too.

313
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,050
All right, Clara?

314
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,050
Oh yes.

315
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:15,050
Peter, what's wrong with you? Are you sick?

316
00:20:15,922 --> 00:20:17,922
Are you hurt? Are you in pain?

317
00:20:17,922 --> 00:20:19,922
Peter, say something!

318
00:20:20,922 --> 00:20:22,922
There's nothing to say at all.

319
00:20:24,922 --> 00:20:26,922
I'm hungry, that's all.

320
00:20:26,922 --> 00:20:28,922
Then you'll get something to eat.

321
00:20:29,922 --> 00:20:31,922
Are we going home?

322
00:20:32,922 --> 00:20:34,194
Wait here for me.

323
00:20:34,194 --> 00:20:36,394
I'll get you something to eat, then you'll feel better.

324
00:20:36,394 --> 00:20:38,394
Oh dear.

325
00:20:38,394 --> 00:20:40,894
I'll be right with you, then it'll be faster.

326
00:20:45,682 --> 00:20:48,182
Do you want to go again tomorrow, child?

327
00:20:48,182 --> 00:20:50,482
I'd love to, but it's too hard for Peter.

328
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:51,482
When will I carry you?

329
00:20:51,482 --> 00:20:54,482
That would be very nice, but I...

330
00:20:54,482 --> 00:20:56,482
Mrs. Klara, how are you?

331
00:20:56,482 --> 00:20:58,482
Why shouldn't I be well?

332
00:20:58,482 --> 00:21:01,482
It was a wonderful day, wonderful, wonderful.

333
00:21:01,482 --> 00:21:03,482
But you should have told me.

334
00:21:03,482 --> 00:21:06,482
What did Mrs. Rottenmeier say earlier, Klara?

335
00:21:06,572 --> 00:21:08,972
Not much yet, but it will come soon.

336
00:21:08,972 --> 00:21:11,772
You can see it in her face when she's furious.

337
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:14,372
If you're talking about me by chance, then you're right.

338
00:21:14,372 --> 00:21:15,972
And I have every reason.

339
00:21:15,972 --> 00:21:17,372
It's hell.

340
00:21:17,372 --> 00:21:19,272
It's the peak of shamelessness.

341
00:21:19,272 --> 00:21:21,172
I'm really sick of fear.

342
00:21:21,172 --> 00:21:23,372
At last, keep your mouth shut.

343
00:21:23,372 --> 00:21:26,772
Don't you see that you're impressed by what you've seen today?

344
00:21:26,772 --> 00:21:29,572
Leave the children alone, at last.

345
00:21:29,572 --> 00:21:32,172
Is it better here? Can you bring the goats back?

346
00:21:32,172 --> 00:21:34,272
Hmm, now I've eaten.

347
00:21:34,272 --> 00:21:35,900
I'll go with you for a while.

348
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,900
You don't need that.

349
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,900
I know I don't need it.

350
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,900
Hurry up, okay?

351
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,900
Goodbye.

352
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,900
Thank you, Peter.

353
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,900
You're welcome.

354
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,900
Nobody told you to shake hands?

355
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,900
Isn't it time for you to go home?

356
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,900
Oh yes, I totally forgot about that.

357
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,900
Peter, Heidi, wait!

358
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,900
Peter!

Why are you crying?

00:22:09,006 --> 00:22:12,206
It was so beautiful today on the flower meadow.

362
00:22:12,406 --> 00:22:15,406
But it was so hard for Peter.

363
00:22:15,806 --> 00:22:18,806
It's so bad that I can't walk.

364
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:22,006
Someone always has to help me.

365
00:22:24,406 --> 00:22:26,406
Calm down.

366
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:32,950
It was exactly what the Alm-Öhi had hoped for.

367
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:37,950
For the first time, Clara wished to be able to run.

368
00:22:45,814 --> 00:22:54,814
The next morning the tears were forgotten and with joy Clara welcomed animals,
flowers and mountains already as old acquaintances.

369
00:22:56,814 --> 00:23:02,814
A few days ago, Heidi had to call her the names of every single flower and every
single beetle.

370
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:06,814
But in the meantime, Clara already knew her way around here as well as Heidi.

371
00:23:07,932 --> 00:23:13,932
For her, every day she was allowed to spend up here on the Alp was a day out of
a fairy tale.

372
00:23:13,932 --> 00:23:19,932
Because Heidi and Peter did everything they could to make her holidays as
beautiful as possible.

373
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:24,932
But we want to tell you about this in our next story.

374
00:23:24,932 --> 00:23:32,932
Heidi, Heidi, your world are the mountains.

375
00:23:32,932 --> 00:23:40,932
Heidi, Heidi, because up here you are at home.

376
00:23:40,932 --> 00:23:46,932
Heidi, Heidi, come home.

377
00:23:46,932 --> 00:23:53,932
Find your happiness, come back again.
