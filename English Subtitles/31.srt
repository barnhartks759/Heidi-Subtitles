00:00:04,494 --> 00:00:09,494
Holadio

2
00:00:12,494 --> 00:00:17,494
Holadio

3
00:00:20,494 --> 00:00:24,494
Heidi

4
00:00:24,494 --> 00:00:28,494
Your world are the mountains

5
00:00:28,494 --> 00:00:32,494
Heidi

6
00:00:32,494 --> 00:00:36,494
Because up here you are at home

7
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:40,494
Dark berries

8
00:00:40,494 --> 00:00:44,494
Green meadows in the sunshine

9
00:00:44,494 --> 00:00:48,494
Heidi, Heidi

10
00:00:48,494 --> 00:00:52,494
You need to be happy

11
00:00:52,494 --> 00:01:00,494
Holadio

12
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:02,494
Holadio

13
00:01:02,494 --> 00:01:05,494
Holadio

14
00:01:05,494 --> 00:01:09,494
Heidi, Heidi

15
00:01:09,494 --> 00:01:11,494
Come home

16
00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:13,494
Find your happiness

17
00:01:13,494 --> 00:01:18,494
Come back home

18
00:01:20,494 --> 00:01:22,494
Where are you, Grandmother? I'm already up there!

19
00:01:22,494 --> 00:01:24,494
This time you wanted to win!

20
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:29,210
Did you at least count the steps or did you forget?

21
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:32,210
I can see that you forgot because of all the enthusiasm.

22
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:35,210
I think I only went up two and then five steps.

23
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,210
Now it's seven steps in total.

24
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:40,210
Good job, Heidi. One, two, three!

25
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,210
Scissors! I won!

26
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,210
One, two, three!

27
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,210
One, two, three!

28
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,210
Now you've won again!

29
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:53,210
That's no wonder. You always just take the paper.

30
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,210
One, two, three!

31
00:01:55,664 --> 00:01:57,664
Stone! Oh!

32
00:01:57,664 --> 00:01:59,164
You fell in!

33
00:01:59,164 --> 00:02:01,164
One, two, three!

34
00:02:01,164 --> 00:02:02,664
Where are you staying?

35
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,664
I don't feel like it anymore, Grandmother.

36
00:02:04,664 --> 00:02:07,664
Just because you're losing? You know what? You're a game-destroyer!

37
00:02:07,664 --> 00:02:09,664
You're right!

38
00:02:09,664 --> 00:02:11,664
One, two, three!

39
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:14,664
Paper wraps the stone, so I won! I can go on for a few more steps!

40
00:02:14,664 --> 00:02:16,664
Another round! You're lucky for the moment!

41
00:02:16,664 --> 00:02:18,664
One, two, three!

42
00:02:18,664 --> 00:02:20,664
Lost again!

43
00:02:20,664 --> 00:02:22,664
One, two, three!

44
00:02:22,664 --> 00:02:25,648
And again! And again!

45
00:02:25,648 --> 00:02:27,648
Paper rolls the stone! Paper rolls the stone!

46
00:02:29,408 --> 00:02:39,988
One, two, three! Hurrah! I won! One, two, three! Hurrah, hurrah!

47
00:02:39,988 --> 00:02:42,778
One, two, three! One, two, three!

48
00:02:42,778 --> 00:02:46,778
Why didn't you two tell me that you play jumping stairs?

49
00:02:46,778 --> 00:02:50,778
It's easy. I didn't know you'd already woken up. I thought you were still
asleep.

50
00:02:50,778 --> 00:02:52,778
Why don't you play with me, Clara?

51
00:02:52,778 --> 00:02:54,778
What do you mean? I'd like to.

52
00:02:54,778 --> 00:02:56,778
I didn't think about it. I'm sorry.

53
00:02:56,778 --> 00:03:00,778
But of course you'll join. You play and I'll run for you.

54
00:03:00,778 --> 00:03:02,778
You think that's possible?

55
00:03:02,778 --> 00:03:04,778
Please let me run, Mrs. Sesemann.

56
00:03:04,778 --> 00:03:07,778
That's really very nice of you, Sebastian.

57
00:03:07,778 --> 00:03:12,778
I've actually gotten a little tired. My poor back.

58
00:03:12,861 --> 00:03:17,861
Are you sitting comfortably on the stairs? Heidi, let's get started. One, two,
three!

59
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:19,861
Paper! Now you've made a scissor!

60
00:03:19,861 --> 00:03:21,861
We've won! You can go up two steps!

61
00:03:21,861 --> 00:03:23,861
Very well. Will be done.

62
00:03:24,861 --> 00:03:26,861
It's not that bad.

63
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:28,861
You're good! You've just won the first game!

64
00:03:28,861 --> 00:03:30,861
One, two, three! Scissors, scissors, paper!

65
00:03:30,861 --> 00:03:33,861
What kind of noise is that? What kind of noise is that in the house today?

66
00:03:33,861 --> 00:03:37,861
Warm up, Miss Clara! Why did you break your nap?

67
00:03:37,861 --> 00:03:39,861
Because I woke up a little earlier today.

68
00:03:40,285 --> 00:03:45,285
There you can see it again! You made so much noise as an unmarried child that
Miss Clara woke up from it.

69
00:03:45,285 --> 00:03:50,285
I asked Heidi to play because I use Clara's lunch breaks to teach her how to
calculate.

70
00:03:50,285 --> 00:03:56,285
Learning to calculate on the staircase? That's what you do in the classroom, at
the table, in a quiet way.

71
00:03:56,285 --> 00:03:58,285
Where is that actually written, Miss Rottenmeier?

72
00:03:58,285 --> 00:04:03,285
It's much easier to learn in the game. I myself have learned to calculate in
this way.

73
00:04:03,805 --> 00:04:07,805
All right, Mrs. Sesemann. From my point of view, you can do whatever you want.

74
00:04:07,805 --> 00:04:10,805
Just destroy the children. It won't take long.

75
00:04:10,805 --> 00:04:13,805
Oh, how good that you remembered me.

76
00:04:14,805 --> 00:04:17,805
I would like to discuss something with you that is very important.

77
00:04:17,805 --> 00:04:19,805
However, alone and in your room.

78
00:04:19,805 --> 00:04:22,805
As you wish. I will wait for you, Mrs. Sesemann.

79
00:04:25,735 --> 00:04:28,735
What does Mrs. Rottenmeier mean by, it's almost over?

80
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:31,735
Who knows what Mrs. Rottenmeier always says when she's angry.

81
00:04:31,735 --> 00:04:34,735
That probably doesn't mean anything at all.

82
00:04:34,735 --> 00:04:37,735
Come on, Clara, let's keep playing, okay?

83
00:04:39,735 --> 00:04:42,735
I'll start now, watch out. One, two and three.

84
00:04:43,735 --> 00:04:46,735
You're moaning, Clara, you have to show your hand earlier.

85
00:04:46,735 --> 00:04:47,735
Sebastian! What is it?

86
00:04:47,735 --> 00:04:48,735
Yes?

87
00:04:49,277 --> 00:04:52,277
She probably didn't say it for no reason.

88
00:04:52,277 --> 00:04:54,277
Yes, I...

89
00:04:54,277 --> 00:04:58,277
Did she mean that Grandmother will be going home soon?

90
00:04:58,277 --> 00:05:00,277
No, no, no...

91
00:05:00,277 --> 00:05:03,277
Is she going home, Sebastian, or not?

92
00:05:03,277 --> 00:05:06,277
Did she say that she will be leaving soon, Sebastian?

93
00:05:06,277 --> 00:05:07,277
Sebastian!

94
00:05:07,277 --> 00:05:08,277
Say it!

95
00:05:08,277 --> 00:05:11,277
Yes, I'm afraid that your Grandmother will be going home soon.

96
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:13,277
Tinette has already packed some clothes.

97
00:05:13,277 --> 00:05:14,277
Clara!

98
00:05:14,277 --> 00:05:18,277
Well, then she will leave us alone again.

99
00:05:18,589 --> 00:05:21,949
That's not true, Klara! Klara, that's not true!

100
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:24,589
Grandmother said she would stay with us for a long time!

101
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:28,029
Yes, I think she's leaving pretty soon.

102
00:05:29,309 --> 00:05:31,229
Come on, Wolf, play with us again.

103
00:05:32,589 --> 00:05:34,269
You can eat me up too.

104
00:05:34,829 --> 00:05:35,549
No?

105
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:40,589
At some point she will have to go home again.

106
00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:42,989
Why? The house is big enough, isn't it?

107
00:05:43,869 --> 00:05:45,629
She really wants to go home.

108
00:05:45,869 --> 00:05:46,989
I see.

109
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:49,981
Then tell her that she can stay here with us.

110
00:05:49,981 --> 00:05:52,381
You think you're particularly smart.

111
00:05:52,381 --> 00:05:54,981
I've tried to tell you a thousand times.

112
00:05:54,981 --> 00:05:56,981
Yes.

113
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:59,581
She lives in a small town, in a small house.

114
00:05:59,581 --> 00:06:01,981
There she has a big garden and she loves it very much.

115
00:06:01,981 --> 00:06:04,581
And besides, she can handle the climate better there.

116
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:07,181
Then you can't do anything anymore, can you?

117
00:06:07,181 --> 00:06:10,981
Still, I don't give up. I want her to stay here, Clara.

118
00:06:10,981 --> 00:06:14,181
Maybe I should tell her that it's not so nice here without her.

119
00:06:14,181 --> 00:06:16,181
Maybe that helps.

120
00:06:17,181 --> 00:06:17,780
I don't know.

121
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:22,780
This has no purpose at all. I've tried it many times.

122
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,780
She's driving, believe me.

123
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,780
No, I won't let that happen.

124
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,780
Heidi...

125
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,780
It's always like that. Father leaves me alone.

126
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,780
Your father always gets these telegrams, but it's different with her.

127
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,780
Grandmother didn't get any telegrams.

128
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,780
It's for nothing.

129
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,780
Hello?

130
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,980
Well, my child, what's on your mind?

131
00:07:05,844 --> 00:07:07,844
So it's true.

132
00:07:12,596 --> 00:07:14,596
What kind of face are you making?

133
00:07:14,596 --> 00:07:16,596
Did you have a fight with Clara?

134
00:07:16,596 --> 00:07:18,596
No.

135
00:07:21,428 --> 00:07:25,428
Oh, of course! I almost forgot about that!

136
00:07:25,428 --> 00:07:29,428
When I was packing, I found these pretty fabric scraps for doll clothes.

137
00:07:29,428 --> 00:07:31,428
You can sew a lot of them.

138
00:07:31,428 --> 00:07:34,428
Maybe this time you can make a snowman out of the wolf.

139
00:07:35,428 --> 00:07:37,428
Here, take it.

140
00:07:38,428 --> 00:07:40,428
Oh, don't you like it?

141
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:43,428
Oh, Heidi.

142
00:07:45,428 --> 00:07:47,428
My little one.

143
00:07:50,676 --> 00:07:55,676
Every visit has to come to an end, even my child.

144
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:58,676
No, he doesn't have to. If you don't want it, he doesn't have to.

145
00:07:58,676 --> 00:08:02,676
But Heidi, you really are a lovely girl.

146
00:08:09,684 --> 00:08:16,684
Heidi, believe me, I also had a lot of fun playing with you and Clara all day.

147
00:08:16,684 --> 00:08:18,684
You will miss me. It was very nice.

148
00:08:18,684 --> 00:08:22,684
Then stay longer if it was fun, okay?

149
00:08:22,684 --> 00:08:25,684
Unfortunately, that's not possible.

150
00:08:25,684 --> 00:08:29,684
But that doesn't mean that we will never see each other again in life.

151
00:08:29,684 --> 00:08:32,684
Will you visit us again? When will you come back?

152
00:08:32,684 --> 00:08:34,442
I can't say that yet.

153
00:08:34,442 --> 00:08:38,442
I will write to you as soon as I am at home and have seen the right one.

154
00:08:38,442 --> 00:08:41,442
Only then can I make new travel plans again.

155
00:08:43,442 --> 00:08:46,442
Now the tears are falling. Then you look prettier.

156
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,442
Goodbye, Grandmother.

157
00:08:48,442 --> 00:08:50,442
Heidi, goodbye, see you soon.

158
00:08:50,442 --> 00:08:53,442
I am looking forward to my next visit with you.

159
00:08:53,442 --> 00:08:55,442
Can't you say when you will come back?

160
00:08:55,442 --> 00:08:57,442
Unfortunately, no.

161
00:08:57,442 --> 00:08:58,442
Also not roughly?

162
00:08:58,442 --> 00:08:59,442
Roughly, yes.

163
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:06,672
I'll come and visit you again when you can read the thick book all by yourself
that I gave you recently. You know what I mean, don't you?

164
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:13,172
There lived a man called Little Muck. I can remember him well.

165
00:09:13,172 --> 00:09:17,672
Little Muck, who I mean, was an old mate when I knew him.

166
00:09:17,672 --> 00:09:24,167
But he was only three or four feet tall and he had a head that was much bigger
and thicker than the other people.

167
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:28,167
He lived alone in a big house and even cooked himself.

168
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:29,967
Why did he cook himself?

169
00:09:29,967 --> 00:09:31,267
Besides, the picture doesn't make sense.

170
00:09:31,267 --> 00:09:33,067
It's from another fairy tale.

171
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:36,367
It doesn't make sense to say it out loud.

172
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,667
I guess I have to read it.

173
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:40,567
Little Muck, little Muck lives in a big house.

174
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:42,267
You only go there every four weeks.

175
00:09:42,267 --> 00:09:43,667
You're such a good boy.

176
00:09:46,167 --> 00:09:47,667
Do you know the fairy tale?

177
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:50,367
Let me see.

178
00:09:52,193 --> 00:09:58,193
Of course. That's the Frog King. The picture shows the princess and the frog.

179
00:09:58,193 --> 00:10:03,193
So, I thought it was the Frog King and not the little mug.

180
00:10:03,193 --> 00:10:07,193
Now I have to start all over again, such a fool.

181
00:10:07,193 --> 00:10:11,193
What are you doing? Why are you saying it out loud? You can read.

182
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:13,193
Sometimes I really can't understand.

183
00:10:13,193 --> 00:10:17,193
Of course I can read, but it takes too long. Saying it out loud is faster.

184
00:10:17,193 --> 00:10:21,193
As soon as I've read the book from the beginning to the end, Grandmother comes
back.

185
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:24,039
Is moggling also valid?

186
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:26,039
You are a small, brave dwarf.

187
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:28,039
You have a head like a mountain.

188
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:31,039
Turn around and look, run and catch us, little Muck.

189
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,039
Poor little Muck.

190
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:34,039
Read what's written there.

191
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:36,039
Why should I? I don't want to know it at all.

192
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:39,039
Heidi, stop moggling, she'll notice.

193
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:43,039
When I tell her in detail to close the book cover, she won't notice.

194
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:45,039
The main thing is, she'll come back.

195
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:47,039
You and your ideas.

196
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:54,039
To be continued

197
00:11:10,497 --> 00:11:16,497
Well? Does anyone of you play along? Heidi, what is it?

198
00:11:18,497 --> 00:11:21,497
Can't you change it?

199
00:11:23,497 --> 00:11:27,497
Don't make it so hard for me. I can't change it.

200
00:11:27,497 --> 00:11:33,497
What do you think if we go for a big walk tomorrow for the farewell?

201
00:11:40,497 --> 00:11:55,497
On my shore there is a fisherman.

202
00:12:00,718 --> 00:12:02,718
Thank you!

203
00:12:42,506 --> 00:12:58,506
There they come.

204
00:12:58,506 --> 00:13:08,106
A real bride at a real wedding.

205
00:13:08,106 --> 00:13:12,606
She's wearing a very pretty dress.

206
00:13:12,606 --> 00:13:17,606
I like that.

207
00:13:17,606 --> 00:13:24,606
And write to us that you have arrived.

208
00:13:24,606 --> 00:13:28,606
We have to hurry, Mother, they're already getting in.

209
00:13:28,606 --> 00:13:31,606
They're already getting in.

210
00:13:31,606 --> 00:13:34,606
Have fun.

211
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:36,606
See you again.

212
00:13:36,606 --> 00:13:37,606
See you later.

213
00:13:37,606 --> 00:13:38,106
See you.

214
00:13:38,106 --> 00:13:39,106
See you later.

215
00:13:39,106 --> 00:13:41,106
See you later.

216
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,550
Have you ever seen a wedding before?

217
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:52,550
Yes, of course, in our mountains, but it was completely different.

218
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:56,550
Write it down! Write it down!

219
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,094
Oh, why are we going...

220
00:13:58,094 --> 00:14:00,094
Why don't we all go home and play a wedding?

221
00:14:00,094 --> 00:14:01,094
Us?

222
00:14:01,094 --> 00:14:04,094
Why not? Heidi can make such beautiful costumes.

223
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:06,094
Come on, Clara, don't be a playboy.

224
00:14:06,094 --> 00:14:07,094
Join us.

225
00:14:10,094 --> 00:14:11,094
If you...

226
00:14:11,374 --> 00:14:13,374
Everything falls down when you move it.

227
00:14:13,374 --> 00:14:16,374
I can't put it any tighter, but it looks nice.

228
00:14:16,374 --> 00:14:18,374
Somehow I find myself very pretty.

229
00:14:18,374 --> 00:14:21,374
I like it so much, it's a pity that I'll never be one later.

230
00:14:21,374 --> 00:14:23,374
What? Why is that, Clara?

231
00:14:23,374 --> 00:14:25,374
You know.

232
00:14:28,374 --> 00:14:28,430
Oh.

233
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:31,430
Oh, come on, don't be afraid. You'll be healthy again at some point.

234
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,430
It can't always stay that way.

235
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,430
Thank you, Heidi. Hopefully.

236
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,430
Who's that?

237
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:41,326
We came to let you live.

238
00:14:41,326 --> 00:14:44,026
Oh, Grandmother has invited guests.

239
00:14:44,026 --> 00:14:47,026
If they are our guests, we have to say good day to them.

240
00:15:11,326 --> 00:15:15,726
Happy birthday to you, Grandmother!

241
00:15:15,739 --> 00:15:16,239
Clara!

242
00:15:16,239 --> 00:15:18,239
All the best for your wedding!

243
00:15:19,303 --> 00:15:23,303
The best for your wedding!

244
00:15:24,303 --> 00:15:30,303
The best for your wedding!

245
00:15:31,303 --> 00:15:33,303
Wonderful!

246
00:15:34,303 --> 00:15:37,303
Musicians, play the dance!

247
00:15:49,303 --> 00:15:53,303
Musicians, play the dance!

248
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:11,303
That's too boring!

249
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,303
Dance like this!

250
00:16:19,303 --> 00:16:22,303
Musicians, play the dance!

251
00:16:25,303 --> 00:16:26,843
That's too boring!

252
00:16:26,843 --> 00:16:28,843
But don't even dance like that!

253
00:16:28,843 --> 00:16:30,523
Yes, why not?

254
00:16:30,535 --> 00:16:32,535
Yes, why not?

255
00:16:53,135 --> 00:16:54,135
So...

256
00:17:18,331 --> 00:17:21,331
Johan, I'm afraid it's about time for the both of us.

257
00:17:22,215 --> 00:17:24,215
I'm afraid it's about time for the both of us.

258
00:17:52,215 --> 00:17:54,215
Dancing is so much fun!

259
00:17:58,376 --> 00:18:02,376
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1!

260
00:18:02,836 --> 00:18:05,876
2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1!

261
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:21,036
The grandmother, Clara, where is the grandmother?

262
00:18:21,716 --> 00:18:23,716
Grandmother, grandmother!

263
00:18:24,716 --> 00:18:27,716
Grandmother, please no!

264
00:18:29,716 --> 00:18:31,716
Grandmother!

265
00:18:32,836 --> 00:18:35,836
No, don't go away!

266
00:18:35,836 --> 00:18:39,836
Grandmother, don't go away! Stay with us!

267
00:18:41,836 --> 00:18:43,836
Grandmother, Grandmother, stay here!

268
00:18:43,836 --> 00:18:48,836
Please don't go away! No, no! Grandmother!

269
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,836
Heidi!

270
00:18:51,836 --> 00:18:57,836
Stay, Heidi! Go home and tell Clara that I'm very, very sorry!

271
00:18:57,836 --> 00:19:02,836
Goodbye! Come back, please!

272
00:19:02,836 --> 00:19:04,836
Goodbye, my child!

273
00:19:04,836 --> 00:19:06,836
Goodbye!

274
00:19:27,836 --> 00:19:30,836
To be continued

275
00:19:50,024 --> 00:19:52,524
It's you, Tinette. Wasn't that a wonderful party?

276
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,524
It's over.

277
00:19:53,524 --> 00:19:55,524
Where are our guests?

278
00:19:55,524 --> 00:19:57,524
Mrs. Rottenmeier threw them out.

279
00:19:57,524 --> 00:19:58,524
To the front door.

280
00:19:58,524 --> 00:20:02,524
Well, at least she slipped on a poppy seed.

281
00:20:03,524 --> 00:20:07,524
You shouldn't be sad, but I really gave it to her.

282
00:20:07,524 --> 00:20:09,524
She took herself impossible in front of people.

283
00:20:09,524 --> 00:20:11,524
Completely impossible.

284
00:20:20,024 --> 00:20:24,024
Clara!

285
00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:33,024
Clara!

286
00:20:35,024 --> 00:20:36,024
Grandmother is gone.

287
00:20:36,024 --> 00:20:38,024
She's secretly gone.

288
00:20:38,024 --> 00:20:39,024
I know.

289
00:20:40,104 --> 00:20:42,104
Just like every time.

290
00:20:42,612 --> 00:20:44,612
To be continued

291
00:21:40,085 --> 00:21:43,085
This nonsense stops right away.

292
00:21:46,085 --> 00:21:48,085
Sounds good.

293
00:21:48,085 --> 00:21:53,085
I really hope that in the time with Mrs. Sesemann your good education has not
been completely lost.

294
00:21:53,085 --> 00:22:01,085
It may have been very entertaining for you all, but we probably want to go back
to behaving like decent young ladies.

295
00:22:01,085 --> 00:22:04,085
I hope you understand what I mean.

296
00:22:04,085 --> 00:22:06,085
The nobility is sitting right now.

297
00:22:06,085 --> 00:22:09,085
Well, as always, she just doesn't listen.

298
00:22:10,085 --> 00:22:12,085
That's the way it is.

299
00:22:15,829 --> 00:22:22,789
Adelheid please. You seem to have forgotten that a lady doesn't snore.

300
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:28,849
Is good. Adelheid, what are you doing again now?

301
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:32,989
Oh, have you forgotten that you have staff for something like that? Sebastian,

302
00:22:32,989 --> 00:22:34,489
where are you? A new spoon.

303
00:22:34,489 --> 00:22:35,829
Thank you, Sebastian.

304

305
00:22:49,653 --> 00:22:54,653
The next morning Mrs. Rottenmeier took over the regiment in the house again.

306
00:22:54,653 --> 00:22:57,653
It was all the same as before the visit of the grandmother.

307
00:22:57,653 --> 00:23:03,653
She scolded every little thing and especially Heidi could not hear a friendly
word from her.

308
00:23:03,653 --> 00:23:08,653
Every morning at ten the Mr. Candidate came and Heidi and Clara had to listen to
him for hours.

309
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:10,653
It was all no longer fun.

310
00:23:10,653 --> 00:23:14,653
She could not stop playing with the two handpuppets either.

311
00:23:15,403 --> 00:23:21,003
It was as if Mrs. Sesemann from the big house there in the Frankfurter Straße
had also taken the laughter with her.

312
00:23:21,003 --> 00:23:24,403
But it didn't take long before Heidi noticed something.

313
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:27,403
And we want to tell you about it next time.
