00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Heide

00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Heide

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Heide

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Heide

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Heide

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Heide

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Heide

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Heide

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Heide

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Heide

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Heide

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Heide

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Heide

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Heide

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Heide

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Heide

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Heide

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Heide

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Come home

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Find your happiness

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Come back again

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Heide, Clara, pass to you

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and even three letters to Heide

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Heide, my legs are no longer as fast as yours

25
00:01:31,642 --> 00:01:34,142
Ah, this untouchable creature!

26
00:01:34,142 --> 00:01:36,142
Just let me stand in the landscape.

27
00:01:39,642 --> 00:01:41,142
A letter for Clara.

28
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,142
One for you.

29
00:01:42,142 --> 00:01:43,142
And one for you.

30
00:01:43,142 --> 00:01:45,142
My letter is from the grandmother.

31
00:01:45,142 --> 00:01:46,642
Imagine, mine too.

32
00:01:46,642 --> 00:01:48,642
It looks like you, that they give individual letters.

33
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:49,642
I want to know what's in it.

34
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:50,642
Open it.

35
00:01:50,642 --> 00:01:51,642
Yes.

36
00:01:53,642 --> 00:01:55,142
Not again.

37
00:01:55,142 --> 00:01:57,642
Imagine, Heidi, she wants to come here.

38
00:01:58,416 --> 00:02:00,416
Read at least loudly.

39
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:03,416
Clara's grandmother says she wants to come here to visit us.

40
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:05,416
You know, the nice one from Frankfurt.

41
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:08,416
Is that the one from which you have the big fairy tale book?

42
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:12,416
Exactly. Grandfather, did you hear that Clara's grandmother is coming?

43
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:16,416
Not only heard, even read myself. It's also in my letter.

44
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:18,416
Do you think it's true?

45
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:20,416
If grandmother writes something, it's always true.

46
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:22,416
Wonderful, wonderful.

47
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:30,416
Oh, Adelheid, stop!

48
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,416
I said stop!

49
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,416
The place is closed!

50
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,416
What are you doing with that, Miss Clara?

51
00:02:38,618 --> 00:02:40,618
Mrs. Clara, are you going to get dizzy?

52
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:43,618
I'm not going to get dizzy, we're just a little happy, that's all.

53
00:02:43,618 --> 00:02:44,618
What do you call your behavior?

54
00:02:44,618 --> 00:02:47,618
I call it monkey theater and not happy.

55
00:02:47,618 --> 00:02:50,618
A lady, Mrs. Clara, has always been reserved to behave.

56
00:02:50,618 --> 00:02:53,618
Even excessive joy is not shown.

57
00:02:53,618 --> 00:02:57,618
Dear Mrs. Rottenmeier, do you know that you are starting to hurt me?

58
00:02:57,618 --> 00:02:59,618
I can do without it for the rest of my life.

59
00:02:59,618 --> 00:03:03,618
I know what you mean by that, but Mrs. Clara is now different from the others.

60
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,986
But why should she understand that?

61
00:03:07,986 --> 00:03:10,486
After all, she is a SESEMAN.

62
00:03:10,486 --> 00:03:13,686
And a SESEMAN is not a mountain farmer.

63
00:03:13,686 --> 00:03:17,186
She looks just like normal people.

64
00:03:17,186 --> 00:03:18,186
Man!

65
00:03:18,186 --> 00:03:22,186
At some point you will understand that you are not making fun of me without
punishment.

66
00:03:26,686 --> 00:03:30,182
Is she angry again? Did I say something wrong earlier?

67
00:03:30,182 --> 00:03:32,782
No, you didn't. I'm sure she already knows.

68
00:03:32,782 --> 00:03:36,182
And since she doesn't get along with my grandmother, she's angry now.

69
00:03:37,782 --> 00:03:41,182
Grandmother can't stand Mrs. Rottenmeier, Heidi.

70
00:03:41,982 --> 00:03:44,782
She's always said that Mrs. Rottenmeier is way too strict.

71
00:03:52,944 --> 00:03:56,784
There must be something behind it, for sure.

72
00:03:56,784 --> 00:04:00,504
I wrote to him that he should come here to see the right one.

73
00:04:00,504 --> 00:04:03,824
And now his mother is coming, whether the AlmÃ¶hi is behind it.

74
00:04:03,824 --> 00:04:05,824
Good bye.

75
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,744
Will you please send me to the hut now, Heidi?

76
00:04:09,744 --> 00:04:11,526
Yes, thank you.

77
00:04:11,526 --> 00:04:17,026
I can't wait, Clara. I just can't wait to see your grandmother again.

78
00:04:17,026 --> 00:04:19,526
I've been so happy to see her in Frankfurt.

79
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:24,526
Do you remember how she showed me her favorite room so I could hide somewhere?

80
00:04:24,526 --> 00:04:28,526
And do you remember how she walked through the city with us?

81
00:04:30,026 --> 00:04:36,526
Yes, but do you remember how she dressed up as a bear and promised us to always
be funny?

82
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:41,870
Sometimes she danced with me and then we sang songs that she taught me.

83
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:45,870
Yes, do you remember how she conjured flowers into the glass in the evening?

84
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,870
Of course I remember that. I remember everything.

85
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:52,870
The hand dolls that she bought us, for example, and the glass melody.

86
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:55,870
Yes, and the many hundred butterflies in my room.

87
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,870
If she had been there, we would have been able to keep the kitten.

88
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,870
Definitely. She was always so nice to me.

89
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,870
Yes, that was her. She liked you very much.

90
00:05:05,894 --> 00:05:10,294
In contrast to Mrs. Rottenmeier. She was sometimes really mean, Heidi.

91
00:05:10,294 --> 00:05:15,094
I always wanted to run away. I wanted to go home all the time. I always wanted
to come here.

92
00:05:15,094 --> 00:05:17,094
But sometimes it was all bad.

93
00:05:34,448 --> 00:05:37,948
Tell me, are you crying, Heidi? What is it?

94
00:05:37,948 --> 00:05:39,948
Oh, nothing.

95
00:05:39,948 --> 00:05:42,948
It's over. I just had to think about something.

96
00:05:42,948 --> 00:05:44,948
Do you know about the time without your grandmother?

97
00:05:44,948 --> 00:05:47,948
When she wasn't there, it wasn't very nice.

98
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:49,948
Yes, I know.

99
00:05:52,948 --> 00:05:54,948
Are you still angry?

100
00:05:54,948 --> 00:05:57,448
No. How do you know that? Not at all!

101
00:05:57,448 --> 00:05:59,448
Heidi!

102
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:06,448
H-heidit!

103
00:06:11,448 --> 00:06:13,448
I'm so sorry!

104
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:22,448
I...

105
00:06:23,448 --> 00:06:23,910
I can't do it anymore.

106
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,910
Can you find her?

107
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,910
She has to come at any moment.

108
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,910
Yes.

109
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,910
There's someone coming! Look!

110
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,910
Grandmother!

111
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,398
Grandmother!

112
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:42,398
I hear the children calling. We'll be up soon.

113
00:06:42,398 --> 00:06:43,398
Hup!

114
00:06:44,398 --> 00:06:45,398
Help me!

115
00:06:45,398 --> 00:06:46,398
Stop!

116
00:06:46,398 --> 00:06:47,398
Put the horse down!

117
00:06:47,398 --> 00:06:48,398
Careful!

118
00:06:48,398 --> 00:06:49,398
Pull the reins!

119
00:06:49,398 --> 00:06:50,398
Hold it back!

120
00:06:50,398 --> 00:06:52,398
Grandmother, help!

121
00:06:52,398 --> 00:06:54,398
Grandmother!

122
00:06:55,718 --> 00:06:58,718
That would have gone almost wrong now.

123
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,718
Heidi, greetings to God, my child.

124
00:07:00,718 --> 00:07:03,718
At least I seem to be alive and not in heaven,

125
00:07:03,718 --> 00:07:06,718
because you are standing in front of me, at least something joyful.

126
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,718
Greetings to God, grandmother.

127
00:07:08,718 --> 00:07:12,718
Please be so kind and help me get down from this elephant.

128
00:07:12,718 --> 00:07:14,718
Yes, of course.

129
00:07:16,718 --> 00:07:19,718
Thank you. How long have we not seen each other?

130
00:07:19,718 --> 00:07:21,718
Incredibly long.

131
00:07:22,188 --> 00:07:27,688
You have grown, my child, and become strong. You look good, Heidi. I'm so happy.

132
00:07:27,688 --> 00:07:29,188
I'm still here.

133
00:07:29,188 --> 00:07:30,188
Clara.

134
00:07:30,188 --> 00:07:32,188
Why aren't you coming here?

135
00:07:32,188 --> 00:07:35,188
Clara isn't sitting in her chair. How nice.

136
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,188
Come on, let's wait for you.

137
00:07:37,188 --> 00:07:39,688
That's really shameless of us.

138
00:07:39,688 --> 00:07:41,688
Welcome!

139
00:07:42,188 --> 00:07:44,688
It's so nice that you came.

140
00:07:44,688 --> 00:07:47,688
I'm also happy about it, Clara, my child.

141
00:07:47,836 --> 00:07:49,836
My little boy.

142
00:07:51,836 --> 00:07:53,836
How good you look.

143
00:07:58,836 --> 00:08:01,836
Tell me, are you really my granddaughter Clara?

144
00:08:01,836 --> 00:08:05,836
I can hardly believe it. You look like a healthy mountain girl.

145
00:08:05,836 --> 00:08:08,836
You must have had a few wonderful holidays up here.

146
00:08:08,836 --> 00:08:10,836
You can see it.

147
00:08:10,836 --> 00:08:12,836
Well, hopefully I will recover as well as you.

148
00:08:12,836 --> 00:08:14,044
Certainly.

149
00:08:14,044 --> 00:08:19,844
Not to be believed, brown, burned and radiant, a completely different girl,
round and healthy.

150
00:08:19,844 --> 00:08:24,844
No, I didn't get fat, but we've been out all day and everything tastes so good.

151
00:08:24,844 --> 00:08:28,044
You don't even know how nice everyone is to me here, Grandmother.

152
00:08:28,044 --> 00:08:31,644
I can imagine it, very good even.

153
00:08:34,644 --> 00:08:37,044
Let's go and greet the AlmÃ¶hi, yes?

154
00:08:40,644 --> 00:08:43,644
I seem to have taken something.

155
00:08:43,644 --> 00:08:43,852
Let's go.

156
00:08:43,852 --> 00:08:45,052
What did you take?

157
00:08:45,052 --> 00:08:47,052
That must be at least a cent.

158
00:08:47,052 --> 00:08:50,052
You're as heavy as a sack of potatoes, my child.

159
00:08:50,052 --> 00:08:53,052
Oh, you're exaggerating. It can't be that much.

160
00:08:53,052 --> 00:08:55,052
Peter can still carry me well.

161
00:08:55,052 --> 00:08:57,052
Peter the goat herder?

162
00:08:57,052 --> 00:09:00,552
Peter was the boy Heidi always told me about in Frankfurt.

163
00:09:00,552 --> 00:09:03,052
Hopefully I'll get to know him soon too.

164
00:09:03,052 --> 00:09:06,052
I'm so curious about your friends, Clara.

165
00:09:06,052 --> 00:09:07,552
You've already seen them all?

166
00:09:07,552 --> 00:09:08,274
Yes.

167
00:09:08,274 --> 00:09:11,074
The goats, the dog, the marmots? ä¹æçåç´ç«ã

Is that to say that you haven't sat on the grass all the time you've been here?

00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:39,986
Of course not! Of course not!

178
00:09:39,986 --> 00:09:44,986
First, it's unhealthy, and secondly, for a lady, it's an extremely unkind lady.

181
00:09:49,486 --> 00:09:52,686

185

Stop making fun of me! Stop making fun ofæ!

186
00:10:02,178 --> 00:10:05,178
Well, she still doesn't have any sense of humor.

187
00:10:05,178 --> 00:10:07,178
Good day, Mrs. Rottenmeier.

188
00:10:07,178 --> 00:10:08,178
Good day!

189
00:10:13,436 --> 00:10:18,436
Welcome, Mrs. Sesemann. I am pleased that you have fulfilled your promise.

190
00:10:18,436 --> 00:10:22,436
Heidi told me a lot about you when she came back.

191
00:10:22,436 --> 00:10:25,436
I can only hope that there was not all too much bad in it.

192
00:10:25,436 --> 00:10:28,436
In any case, she talked a lot about you.

193
00:10:28,436 --> 00:10:31,436
And now that I see you...

194
00:10:31,436 --> 00:10:33,436
Do you know what I think, Clara?

195
00:10:33,436 --> 00:10:35,436
Heidi confused you with a picture.

196
00:10:35,436 --> 00:10:38,436
Excuse me, please. I don't know what you mean.

197
00:10:38,436 --> 00:10:42,994
Heidi brought no picture with her from Frankfurt.

198
00:10:42,994 --> 00:10:45,994
Oh, for heaven's sake, that's not what it was meant to be.

199
00:10:45,994 --> 00:10:48,994
We have an old oil shaker at home in Frankfurt.

200
00:10:48,994 --> 00:10:52,994
Oh, excuse me, an old oil painting that the children loved very much.

201
00:10:52,994 --> 00:10:56,994
The picture shows St. Joseph and he looks like you.

202
00:10:56,994 --> 00:10:58,994
That's what it was meant to be.

203
00:10:58,994 --> 00:11:01,994
Oh, excuse me, please, that I reacted so strangely.

204
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,994
But I thought you thought Heidi had taken something that didn't belong to you.

205
00:11:04,994 --> 00:11:06,722
Heidi?

206
00:11:06,722 --> 00:11:10,522
For God's sake, how did you come up with the idea that I could think of
something like that?

207
00:11:10,522 --> 00:11:13,722
Apparently I never learn to express myself properly.

208
00:11:15,922 --> 00:11:18,522
Tell me, grandfather, do you want to stand here forever?

209
00:11:18,522 --> 00:11:20,722
Why don't we go and sit down?

210
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:23,722
You're right. We stand here and talk.

211
00:11:23,722 --> 00:11:26,722
And you have to be tired of the exhausting journey.

212
00:11:26,722 --> 00:11:28,722
Should I get you some fresh milk right away?

213
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:30,722
Yes, please, Heidi. That would be nice.

214
00:11:31,554 --> 00:11:35,554
Now I'm finally going to try the goat's milk you've always written to me.

215
00:11:35,554 --> 00:11:37,554
I'm so curious.

216
00:11:38,554 --> 00:11:40,554
All right, let's go.

217
00:11:43,554 --> 00:11:47,554
Why don't you go, Grandmother? What's the matter with you?

218
00:11:47,554 --> 00:11:51,554
Oh, Heidi, I just thought of something for a moment.

219
00:11:51,554 --> 00:11:53,554
Come on, I'll show you everything.

220
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,554
I'll show you everything.

221
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,410
Do you like goat milk as much as I do?

222
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,910
I think it's delicious.

223
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:21,410
I think everything is wonderful. I can't believe it.

224
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,910
I sit here in this wonderful landscape,

225
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,910
drink milk and a few days ago I was in the big city.

226
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,410
I think I'm dreaming.

227
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,410
It can't be reality.

228
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,410
I can understand how you feel,

229
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,910
but please excuse me, I have to...

230
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,410
What a pity.

231
00:12:38,482 --> 00:12:40,482
May I ask you something?

232
00:12:40,482 --> 00:12:40,982
Yes?

233
00:12:40,982 --> 00:12:45,482
Did you happen to read the letter that I wrote to your son a few days ago?

234
00:12:45,482 --> 00:12:49,482
No, I only heard that you sent him a letter.

235
00:12:49,482 --> 00:12:52,482
Mrs. Sesemann, I have to talk to you.

236
00:12:52,482 --> 00:12:55,482
If your granddaughter stays here any longer,

237
00:12:55,482 --> 00:12:57,482
not only will her studies not be picked up anymore,

238
00:12:57,482 --> 00:12:59,482
but also her behavior will be ruined.

239
00:12:59,482 --> 00:13:01,482
Since Mrs. Clara looks a little healthier,

240
00:13:01,482 --> 00:13:04,482
the purpose of your visit here seems to be fulfilled.

241
00:13:04,482 --> 00:13:05,982
I'm on immediate leave.

242
00:13:05,982 --> 00:13:06,982
No!

243
00:13:07,032 --> 00:13:09,032
I don't want to go home yet.

244
00:13:09,032 --> 00:13:14,032
No, Grandmother, be honest, you didn't come here to get me out of here, did you?

245
00:13:16,032 --> 00:13:21,032
Dear Miss Rottenmeier, I'm afraid you have to explain everything to me in more
detail.

246
00:13:21,032 --> 00:13:24,032
Yes, I can. Miss Clara refuses to listen to me.

247
00:13:24,032 --> 00:13:30,032
She doesn't take a nap, doesn't take her medicine, and neglects the written
homework.

248
00:13:31,032 --> 00:13:32,032
Is that so?

249
00:13:34,032 --> 00:13:36,032
What a mischievous child.

250
00:13:36,872 --> 00:13:40,272
I have to say, if I look at our Clara like that,

251
00:13:40,272 --> 00:13:43,772
then she doesn't seem to need any medicine at all, does she?

252
00:13:43,772 --> 00:13:44,772
Uh-huh.

253
00:13:46,572 --> 00:13:47,972
And what about books?

254
00:13:47,972 --> 00:13:50,372
She should keep her eyes open and look around.

255
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:51,372
What do you mean?

256
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,372
I'm afraid I don't understand her.

257
00:13:55,372 --> 00:13:57,572
Clara has also once earned holidays

258
00:13:57,572 --> 00:14:01,172
and I am very happy that they are such beautiful holidays.

259
00:14:01,496 --> 00:14:04,796
Tell me, what did you do? What did you spend your time with?

260
00:14:04,796 --> 00:14:08,296
We were with the goat herd on the pasture, where they go every day.

261
00:14:08,296 --> 00:14:11,196
And then we were even further up, on the flower meadow.

262
00:14:11,896 --> 00:14:15,196
Yes, tell me, did you do all that with the wheelchair?

263
00:14:15,196 --> 00:14:17,196
No, Peter carried it on his back.

264
00:14:17,196 --> 00:14:19,696
He made an extra carrier for me.

265
00:14:20,196 --> 00:14:22,696
The heavy child, all the way?

266
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:25,896
Yes, how big is the boy? That must be a giant.

267
00:14:25,896 --> 00:14:28,196
I couldn't even lift you up before.

268
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:36,016
Clara and Heidi, the grandmother, described everything they had experienced
together in the past few days.

269
00:14:36,016 --> 00:14:39,416
Clara was particularly fond of the rainbow they had seen.

270
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:44,416
And Heidi reported how Clara and Peter had told a fairy tale under the tent.

271
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:47,716
Mrs. Sesemann only understood the children's enthusiasm too well.

272
00:14:47,716 --> 00:14:51,416
She was happy to see her granddaughter so happy and carefree.

273
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:55,116
It must have been a wonderful experience for the children, Mrs. Rottenmeier.

274
00:14:55,116 --> 00:14:58,516
I just don't understand that Mr. Almey let her go alone.

275
00:14:58,516 --> 00:14:59,183
That's not...

276
00:14:59,183 --> 00:15:03,383
That's exactly what I think, Mrs. Sesemann, but he was deaf to my arguments.

277
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:08,983
See? That's why I wrote the letter. He's got an incredible big head.

278
00:15:09,183 --> 00:15:11,983
Sometimes I talked to him like I talked to a little child.

279
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,783
I'll ask him for his reasons.

280
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:17,183
That's why I'm here.

281
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:21,183
And now to you. Of course, you can't go without homework.

282
00:15:21,806 --> 00:15:24,606
But you just said that I earned my holidays.

283
00:15:24,606 --> 00:15:27,806
Yes, I said that. And you also had your holidays.

284
00:15:27,806 --> 00:15:32,406
But I think, Clara, it's not too much to ask if you do homework for an hour
every day.

285
00:15:32,406 --> 00:15:34,606
The day is so long.

286
00:15:34,606 --> 00:15:38,406
Well, if it has to be. But I don't think that's nice of you.

287
00:15:38,406 --> 00:15:40,606
If you learn with me, it'll be faster.

288
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,806
It has to be.

289
00:15:41,806 --> 00:15:45,406
Please, Grandmother, but not more than an hour every day.

290
00:15:45,406 --> 00:15:47,406
An hour is long enough.

291
00:15:47,406 --> 00:15:50,406
Yes, an hour is enough.

292
00:15:51,806 --> 00:15:54,806
To be continued

293
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,520
I don't know anything about that.

294
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,520
My son didn't tell me that.

295
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,520
I understand him very well.

296
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,520
I assume he wanted to save you from disappointment.

297
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,520
There is a chance that Clara can walk?

298
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,520
I don't understand that at all.

299
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,520
I know it's just a hope, but at least that.

300
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,520
I haven't dared to think about it all these years,

301
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,520
let alone say it out at some point.

302
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:34,230
How did that happen? Why do you think she'll be able to walk again one day?

303
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:37,230
I'm sorry for my excitement, but it's so surprising.

304
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,230
We've already visited so many doctors and experienced disappointments.

305
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:43,230
I don't know if you can imagine what that's like.

306
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:46,230
Maybe Clara will be able to walk again.

307
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:50,230
Maybe she'll lead a normal life, just like all the other girls in her age.

308
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,230
Believe me, Mrs. Sesemann.

309
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:55,230
For me, it's no longer hope.

310
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:57,230
For me, it's certainty.

311
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,102
Yes?

312
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:03,102
I've observed Clara's behavior in the last few weeks.

313
00:17:03,102 --> 00:17:05,102
How she moves, what she does, how she reacts.

314
00:17:05,102 --> 00:17:08,102
She will be able to walk again one day.

315
00:17:08,102 --> 00:17:11,102
No, you can't be sure.

316
00:17:12,102 --> 00:17:13,102
But I am sure.

317
00:17:13,102 --> 00:17:17,102
And that's why I want to ask you to leave her here longer than you originally
planned.

318
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:19,102
You have to leave it to chance.

319
00:17:19,102 --> 00:17:21,102
It can go very fast.

320
00:17:22,102 --> 00:17:24,102
But it can also take an eternity.

321
00:17:24,102 --> 00:17:27,102
Because, unfortunately, she doesn't dare to do it herself.

322
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:33,470
Unfortunately, she has not yet understood how wonderful it is to walk around
with other children and to die.

323
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:38,470
She has felt the desire, but not intense enough, and we have to bring her to
that.

324
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:43,470
She must think of nothing else but the desire to finally be able to walk.

325
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:50,470
I understand, so that's why you left her alone with the children on the pasture.

326
00:17:51,086 --> 00:17:55,086
You will get any kind of support from me that you need to help Clara.

327
00:17:55,086 --> 00:18:01,086
And I'm sure, if someone is able to give you self-confidence, then you, Alm-Ãhi.

328
00:18:01,086 --> 00:18:05,086
I'm so nervous, I can't even understand it.

329
00:18:05,086 --> 00:18:10,086
Keep Clara here as long as you think it's right, okay?

330
00:18:12,086 --> 00:18:17,086
We're done, Grandmother, we only started today with half an hour.

331
00:18:17,988 --> 00:18:21,788
Oh, there you are. Are you going to play with us now? We're done.

332
00:18:21,788 --> 00:18:23,588
Unfortunately, no.

333
00:18:23,588 --> 00:18:26,788
I can't. I urgently have to speak to Miss Rottenmeier.

334
00:18:26,788 --> 00:18:28,588
So, and we've learned.

335
00:18:28,588 --> 00:18:32,988
We only did that because you promised to play with us afterwards.

336
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:35,388
You used to keep your promises.

337
00:18:35,388 --> 00:18:36,988
Don't pull a face.

338
00:18:36,988 --> 00:18:40,788
At the moment it's not possible. We still have so many days left to play.

339
00:18:40,788 --> 00:18:44,788
That's not true. You'll probably be leaving again soon, as always.

340
00:18:44,788 --> 00:18:46,164
Not this time.

341
00:18:46,164 --> 00:18:49,764
This time I'm not leaving voluntarily at all. This time I'm staying.

342
00:18:49,764 --> 00:18:52,964
Are you lying to yourself? You're exaggerating again.

343
00:18:52,964 --> 00:18:57,164
Maybe I'm exaggerating a little. Maybe I'm also lying a little.

344
00:18:59,564 --> 00:19:01,964
Do you understand what's going on with you?

345
00:19:01,964 --> 00:19:04,364
The two of them must have talked about something.

346
00:19:04,364 --> 00:19:06,364
Yes, what can that be?

347
00:19:06,364 --> 00:19:08,564
I could burst out of curiosity.

348
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,964
I'd rather not.

349
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:16,798
I'm sorry, I have to disturb you. I have to discuss something with you.

350
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:18,798
What is it?

351
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:24,798
I would like to ask you to return to Frankfurt by the next train.

352
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:26,372
In heaven's name!

353
00:19:26,372 --> 00:19:32,872
In my opinion, the servants have been alone in the house for too long, and you
know, there are always difficulties without supervision.

354
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:35,372
I fully understand that.

355
00:19:35,372 --> 00:19:39,372
Then it's good. Make sure that everything goes as usual in Frankfurt.

356
00:19:39,372 --> 00:19:42,172
Just too much! You don't even know how much I hate this place!

357
00:19:42,172 --> 00:19:45,172
This smell of goats and cheese makes me crazy!

358
00:19:45,172 --> 00:19:47,172
I immediately pack clear things.

359
00:19:47,172 --> 00:19:49,672
Oh no, I was just talking about you.

360
00:19:49,672 --> 00:19:50,672
What, please?

361
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:56,756
I, uh, I don't know, did I, uh, possibly, I mean, did you just say I was just
talking about you?

362
00:19:56,756 --> 00:20:04,756
That's exactly what I said. I can understand that you're surprised, but I need
you in Frankfurt and I want my granddaughter to stay here for a while.

363
00:20:04,756 --> 00:20:08,756
You're not going to leave mother souls alone here in this wilderness, are you?

364
00:20:08,756 --> 00:20:15,756
Yes, and I've never raised Clara as well as I do at the moment. Here she gets
everything she needs, do you understand?

365
00:20:16,228 --> 00:20:19,028
Love, understanding, friendship, and security.

366
00:20:19,028 --> 00:20:22,028
Haven't you noticed how happy she is here yet?

367
00:20:25,028 --> 00:20:27,028
You want to take her away from me?

368
00:20:27,028 --> 00:20:30,028
You're acting as if you don't get all of this from me.

369
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:33,028
This child is my one and only, my life's content.

370
00:20:34,028 --> 00:20:36,028
Calm down.

371
00:20:39,028 --> 00:20:41,528
Please forgive me, I shouldn't have let myself go.

372
00:20:41,528 --> 00:20:43,528
I know it will never happen again.

373
00:20:46,228 --> 00:20:48,228
Please forgive me, I shouldn't have let myself go.

374
00:20:52,702 --> 00:20:56,702
Take care of yourself, Clara, and come home strong and healthy.

375
00:20:56,702 --> 00:21:00,702
Please don't be so nice to your AlmÃ¶hi, she's so tender and helpless.

376
00:21:00,702 --> 00:21:03,702
Please, children, don't overdo it.

377
00:21:03,702 --> 00:21:06,702
Man, Heidi, Mrs. Rottenmeier is crying.

378
00:21:06,702 --> 00:21:11,702
Yes, I'm crying. Even a teacher has human feelings, but that doesn't interest
you.

379
00:21:11,702 --> 00:21:14,702
Yes, you've never seen that.

380
00:21:14,702 --> 00:21:17,702
With a good education, she would have spared herself this answer.

381
00:21:17,702 --> 00:21:19,702
I'll talk to you about it later.

382
00:21:20,202 --> 00:21:22,202
Oh, Peter's coming!

383
00:21:22,202 --> 00:21:24,202
Then I'll finally get to know him.

384
00:21:24,202 --> 00:21:26,202
This Peter must be a very talented boy.

385
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:28,202
He did so much for Clara.

386
00:21:28,202 --> 00:21:30,202
Come on, you two!

387
00:21:30,202 --> 00:21:32,202
Peter, imagine, the grandmother is here!

388
00:21:34,202 --> 00:21:36,202
Good day, Peter.

389
00:21:36,202 --> 00:21:38,202
You don't even know how happy I am to see you.

390
00:21:38,202 --> 00:21:40,202
I am the grandmother.

391
00:21:40,202 --> 00:21:42,202
Good evening.

392
00:21:42,202 --> 00:21:44,202
I would have recognized you everywhere.

393
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:46,202
That's exactly how Heidi described you.

394
00:21:46,202 --> 00:21:48,202
You are unique.

395
00:21:49,354 --> 00:21:53,854
Clara wrote that you can cut so well, that's why I brought you something.

396
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,854
A pocket knife.

397
00:21:55,854 --> 00:22:00,854
I want to thank you for being so nice to my Clara.

398
00:22:00,854 --> 00:22:05,854
I've always been nice. Just wonderful. I've always wanted something like that.

399
00:22:05,854 --> 00:22:07,854
We chose it.

400
00:22:07,854 --> 00:22:08,854
Me?

401
00:22:08,854 --> 00:22:11,854
Well done. Now you have to cut something for her.

402
00:22:11,854 --> 00:22:14,854
I'd love to, you know.

403
00:22:14,854 --> 00:22:20,854
See you in Frankfurt, Ms. Rottenmeier.

404
00:22:20,854 --> 00:22:23,854
See you. Good luck. See you tomorrow.

405
00:22:30,854 --> 00:22:32,372
Did you win?

406
00:22:32,372 --> 00:22:34,372
Did you know that Miss Rottenmeier can cry?

407
00:22:34,372 --> 00:22:36,372
I would never have dared to tell her.

408
00:22:36,372 --> 00:22:38,372
You look weird.

409
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:53,180
The next day brought many, many new experiences for Clara and Heidi.

410
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:59,180
They got up even earlier than usual and to their own surprise, they regretted
that Mrs. Rottenmeier left.

411
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:03,180
Immediately after breakfast, Grandmother came up the mountain.

412
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:06,180
This time she went to Clara's joy, the horse did not pass.

413
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:09,180
In the morning they all made a trip together.

414
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:13,180
Even Josef went, Mrs. Sesemann to love, voluntarily with.

415
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,010
Apparently he wanted to make a good impression.

416
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:20,770
It was a beautiful peaceful day, except for one experience.

417
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:27,010
Well, that was less peaceful, but we want to tell you about it in our next
story.
