00:00:04,526 --> 00:00:09,526
Holadio

2
00:00:12,526 --> 00:00:17,526
Holadio

3
00:00:20,526 --> 00:00:24,526
Heidi

4
00:00:24,526 --> 00:00:28,526
Your world are the mountains

5
00:00:28,526 --> 00:00:32,526
Heidi

6
00:00:32,526 --> 00:00:36,526
Because up here you are at home

7
00:00:36,526 --> 00:00:40,526
Dark firs

8
00:00:40,526 --> 00:00:44,526
Green meadows in the sunshine

9
00:00:44,526 --> 00:00:48,526
Heidi, Heidi

10
00:00:48,526 --> 00:00:52,526
You need to be happy

11
00:00:52,526 --> 00:01:01,526
Holadio

12
00:01:01,526 --> 00:01:02,526
Holadio

13
00:01:02,526 --> 00:01:05,526
Holadio

14
00:01:05,526 --> 00:01:09,526
Heidi, Heidi

15
00:01:09,526 --> 00:01:11,526
Come home

16
00:01:11,526 --> 00:01:13,526
Find your happiness

17
00:01:13,526 --> 00:01:18,526
Come back home

18
00:01:22,106 --> 00:01:26,906
the other and the youngest was not much over the length of his fingers when he
was born.

19
00:01:26,906 --> 00:01:32,506
That's why he was called DÃ¤umeling. He grew up a little afterwards ...

20
00:01:32,506 --> 00:01:36,906
... slightly over the ear.

21
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:45,210
Oh, I was in the wrong line with my finger.

22
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,210
The little thumb is in the ear of the horse. That's smart.

23
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:58,210
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, N...

24
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,210
Adelheid!

25
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:00,210
Yes?

26
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,210
Adelheid?

27
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:04,210
Oh, there you are, child. What are you still waiting for?

28
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,210
Time to study.

29
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,210
From the Rottenmeier?

30
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:11,210
Yes, please, dear lady.

31
00:02:11,808 --> 00:02:15,808
Come in. I want to talk to you in my room.

32
00:02:15,808 --> 00:02:19,808
But not now. The children's class starts in a moment.

33
00:02:19,808 --> 00:02:24,808
Yes, right now, because I want to talk to you about the two children's class.

34
00:02:26,808 --> 00:02:28,808
Please.

35
00:02:30,808 --> 00:02:35,808
Anna, apple, evening, Anna...

36
00:02:36,218 --> 00:02:38,218
Anne-Marie!

37
00:02:38,218 --> 00:02:39,218
Anne-Marie!

38
00:02:39,218 --> 00:02:40,218
Apple,

39
00:02:40,218 --> 00:02:41,218
Axe,

40
00:02:41,218 --> 00:02:42,218
Eagle,

41
00:02:42,218 --> 00:02:43,218
All,

42
00:02:43,218 --> 00:02:44,218
All,

43
00:02:44,218 --> 00:02:45,218
All,

44
00:02:45,218 --> 00:02:46,218
All,

45
00:02:46,218 --> 00:02:47,218
Fear,

46
00:02:47,218 --> 00:02:48,218
Whore,

47
00:02:48,218 --> 00:02:49,218
An,

48
00:02:49,218 --> 00:02:50,138
An,

49
00:02:50,138 --> 00:02:54,138
Climb. Anchor. And now the B.

50
00:02:54,138 --> 00:02:59,138
Bertha Ball Besen Blumenbeet.

51
00:03:05,343 --> 00:03:09,343
Grandmother taught you that. Heidi can read now.

52
00:03:13,343 --> 00:03:14,343
Yes, I can!

53
00:03:15,343 --> 00:03:16,343
Lies!

54
00:03:18,343 --> 00:03:21,343
Oh, I don't believe that, I don't believe that!

55
00:03:22,343 --> 00:03:24,343
When I have to experience that, a miracle has happened.

56
00:03:24,343 --> 00:03:27,343
Since the twelfth year of my life, I no longer believe in miracles.

57
00:03:27,343 --> 00:03:31,343
This brings all the newly established rules of pedagogy and science together.

58
00:03:31,343 --> 00:03:34,343
I studied for nothing.

59
00:03:35,343 --> 00:03:36,415
I don't believe in miracles.

60
00:03:36,415 --> 00:03:39,415
Tell me, do you know what he has?

61
00:03:39,415 --> 00:03:41,415
He wonders that you can read all of a sudden.

62
00:03:41,415 --> 00:03:43,415
He just doesn't want to believe it.

63
00:03:46,415 --> 00:03:48,415
Don't you want tea?

64
00:03:48,415 --> 00:03:52,415
And what does Heidi do when Clara has to hold her nap?

65
00:03:52,415 --> 00:03:56,415
Then she stays in her room, as I called her.

66
00:03:56,453 --> 00:03:59,053
But she always thinks up all sorts of stories.

67
00:03:59,053 --> 00:04:02,853
I mean, I don't care what she does, but she tells them afterwards, Clara.

68
00:04:02,853 --> 00:04:06,553
I would certainly think up stories if I was locked up in my room.

69
00:04:06,553 --> 00:04:08,553
Do you really think that's necessary?

70
00:04:10,053 --> 00:04:11,853
Yes, please, come in.

71
00:04:11,853 --> 00:04:14,653
It's a miracle in our house.

72
00:04:14,653 --> 00:04:18,653
The Swiss child can read. Isn't that wonderful? She can read!

73
00:04:18,653 --> 00:04:22,153
Before I believe you, I have to have seen it with my own eyes.

74
00:04:22,153 --> 00:04:24,853
You're right, it's hard to believe, but it's true.

75
00:04:24,933 --> 00:04:29,433
Yesterday she couldn't distinguish A from B, and today she's just sitting there
and can read.

76
00:04:29,433 --> 00:04:33,433
Adalbert, Annemarie, evening, flower bed.

77
00:04:33,433 --> 00:04:38,933
And imagine, she can even read the difficult word flower bed, and no one has to
help her.

78
00:04:38,933 --> 00:04:39,933
What do you say?

79
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:43,933
Wonderful, I immediately thought that she would learn it with the right book.

80
00:04:43,933 --> 00:04:48,433
Oh, this book must be able to conjure, Mrs. Sesemann.

81
00:04:48,433 --> 00:04:50,433
Nonsense, I knew it.

82
00:04:50,677 --> 00:04:55,677
I saw it right away. She is such a clever, loving, little thing. I will reward
you for it.

83
00:04:55,677 --> 00:05:01,677
Mr. Candidate, you have a break now. This Heidi is a wonderful child.

84
00:05:06,677 --> 00:05:10,677
You can read. You don't believe how happy I am.

85
00:05:12,677 --> 00:05:15,677
It was much easier than I thought. It wasn't difficult at all.

86
00:05:15,677 --> 00:05:17,557
Anne-Marie, evening?

87
00:05:17,557 --> 00:05:18,557
And Adalbert.

88
00:05:18,557 --> 00:05:21,557
Whoever reads so fast deserves a reward.

89
00:05:21,557 --> 00:05:23,557
A reward? Hooray!

90
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:24,557
Slowly.

91
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:25,557
What's that?

92
00:05:25,557 --> 00:05:27,557
That's a secret.

93
00:05:27,557 --> 00:05:30,557
But don't tell Miss Rottenmeier.

94
00:05:32,557 --> 00:05:34,557
Do you know what it could be?

95
00:05:41,557 --> 00:05:43,557
Sit down, please.

96
00:05:43,557 --> 00:05:45,557
Mr. Candidate isn't here to go on vacation.

97
00:05:45,557 --> 00:05:47,557
Discipline!

98
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,879
Grandmother, please don't go away so soon.

99
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,879
Please, Grandmother, yes? Heidi also wants you to stay here.

100
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:05,879
But Clara, now I'm here and I'll stay too.

101
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:07,879
Now sleep well for an hour.

102
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:11,879
And then I'll wake you up and then we'll play together again.

103
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:13,879
I'm curious about the surprise.

104
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:15,879
You can do that too.

105
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:26,879
Yes?

106
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,420
Hello, Grandmother!

107
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,620
Hello, Heidi. I'm so bored.

108
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,020
Do you want to play with me?

109
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,820
You want to play with me?

110
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,420
Uh-huh.

111
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,420
Oh, yes.

112
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,820
One, two, three.

113
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,220
Scissors or stone?

114
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,620
You won.

115
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,020
One, two, three.

116
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,820
Now I can finally climb a few steps.

117
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,420
One, two, three.

118
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,020
Well, you have a good laugh.

119
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,420
One, two, three.

120
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,020
Stone grinds the scissors. Edge!

121
00:07:05,962 --> 00:07:07,962
Tell me, you're better than I thought.

122
00:07:07,962 --> 00:07:09,962
Are you really playing the game for the first time?

123
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,962
One, two, three!

124
00:07:13,962 --> 00:07:15,962
Hurray! We won, we won, we won!

125
00:07:15,962 --> 00:07:17,962
Unfortunately, you lost.

126
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:21,404
We haven't been on the roof for a long time.

127
00:07:21,404 --> 00:07:24,404
That's right. Then you have to work hard.

128
00:07:24,404 --> 00:07:26,404
Only a few more steps.

129
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,404
I'm still winning. One, two, three.

130
00:07:28,404 --> 00:07:29,404
Won!

131
00:07:29,404 --> 00:07:30,404
Again nothing.

132
00:07:30,404 --> 00:07:32,404
One, two, three, four.

133
00:07:32,404 --> 00:07:36,404
One, two, one, two, one, two, three.

134
00:07:36,404 --> 00:07:39,404
Finally I've won too.

135
00:07:39,404 --> 00:07:43,404
One, two, one, two, one, two, three.

136
00:07:43,404 --> 00:07:45,404
You're definitely not getting me in anymore.

137
00:07:45,404 --> 00:07:47,332
I'm almost at the top.

138
00:07:47,332 --> 00:07:52,708
these steps here. One, two, one, two, one, two, three.

139
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:56,068
They cut paper! I've won again! Wonderful!

140
00:07:57,188 --> 00:08:00,308
One, two, one, two, one, two, three!

141
00:08:01,508 --> 00:08:03,508
Finally, a few more steps up.

142
00:08:03,508 --> 00:08:04,508
Quiet!

143
00:08:04,508 --> 00:08:08,508
One, two, one, two, one, two, three!

144
00:08:08,508 --> 00:08:11,508
Scissors, paper, scissors, you won!

145
00:08:11,508 --> 00:08:14,508
One, two, three!

146
00:08:14,508 --> 00:08:16,508
Adelheid, stop!

147
00:08:17,444 --> 00:08:23,444
How many times do I have to tell you that you have to be quiet in the house
during the quiet hours?

148
00:08:23,444 --> 00:08:26,444
Look at me when I talk to you and go to your room.

149
00:08:32,964 --> 00:08:36,964
Mrs. Sesemann is not a little girl, please notice that!

150
00:08:36,964 --> 00:08:37,964
But the grandmother said...

151
00:08:37,964 --> 00:08:39,964
Humble women, not grandmothers!

152
00:08:39,964 --> 00:08:42,964
Stop behaving as if you were part of the family.

153
00:08:42,964 --> 00:08:44,964
You are strange here.

154
00:09:16,224 --> 00:09:16,713
Thanks for watching and till next time!

155
00:09:16,713 --> 00:09:21,713
If you want to go home to your grandfather, then please tell him that I've
learned to read.

156
00:09:23,713 --> 00:09:24,713
Oh dear.

157
00:09:25,713 --> 00:09:26,713
Yes?

158
00:09:27,713 --> 00:09:29,713
You're alone, that's good.

159
00:09:35,081 --> 00:09:38,081
Come on, we'll continue to play, but this time I'll win.

160
00:09:38,081 --> 00:09:42,081
No, Miss Rottenmeier said I'm not allowed to play with you anymore.

161
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,081
And I'm supposed to say merciful woman.

162
00:09:44,081 --> 00:09:46,081
Aha, she says that.

163
00:09:46,081 --> 00:09:49,081
I'll probably have to talk to her about it later.

164
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:50,081
Forget it, Heidi.

165
00:09:50,081 --> 00:09:53,081
The way you talk to me, it's just something between us.

166
00:09:53,081 --> 00:09:54,081
You and me.

167
00:09:54,081 --> 00:09:56,081
Do we want to play together or not?

168
00:09:56,081 --> 00:09:58,081
If you come up with a game.

169
00:09:58,081 --> 00:10:00,081
Do you know this key, Heidi?

170
00:10:00,081 --> 00:10:02,081
No, what kind of key is that?

171
00:10:02,081 --> 00:10:04,081
That's a magic key, of course.

172
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,959
Don't you recognize it?

173
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,959
Yes, I do.

174
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,959
Oh, so many books.

175
00:10:18,505 --> 00:10:21,505
And this is the magic land that I mean.

176
00:10:22,505 --> 00:10:25,505
Come with me, Heidi. What are you waiting for?

177
00:10:25,505 --> 00:10:28,505
Ah, fuck!

178
00:10:45,865 --> 00:10:48,865
When I was a child, I often came here.

179
00:10:48,865 --> 00:10:52,865
I sat on this sofa for hours and dreamed.

180
00:10:52,865 --> 00:10:57,865
Just imagine, I always imagined I was Rapunzel.

181
00:11:01,481 --> 00:11:05,481
When you open it, he starts singing from the front again.

182
00:11:05,481 --> 00:11:07,481
But there are even more beautiful things hidden here.

183
00:11:07,481 --> 00:11:09,481
Just come with me.

184
00:11:11,481 --> 00:11:13,481
I've always imagined it to be here.

185
00:11:13,481 --> 00:11:17,481
But it has to be somewhere here. I don't understand.

186
00:11:17,481 --> 00:11:20,481
Maybe I should clean up after all.

187
00:11:51,493 --> 00:11:52,777
Motherfucker.

188
00:11:52,777 --> 00:11:54,777
The mountains, the grandfather,

189
00:11:54,777 --> 00:11:56,777
Svenja and Berli.

190
00:11:56,777 --> 00:11:58,777
And down there is Peter.

191
00:11:58,777 --> 00:12:00,777
You can even see my little cuties.

192
00:12:10,094 --> 00:12:12,094
So, I found it.

193
00:12:13,094 --> 00:12:15,094
Where else could it have been?

194
00:12:17,094 --> 00:12:20,094
Now you're going to experience a surprise, Heidi.

195
00:12:23,094 --> 00:12:24,094
Heidi!

196
00:12:40,014 --> 00:12:43,014
But Heidi, what's wrong with my child?

197
00:12:49,198 --> 00:12:55,198
I see. The picture up there reminds you of the mountains, doesn't it, little
one?

198
00:12:55,198 --> 00:13:00,198
You're home, my child. Were you so happy in the mountains with your grandfather?

199
00:13:04,198 --> 00:13:09,198
Come on, calm down, my love. I think I know how to comfort you.

200
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:34,198
That's it!

201
00:13:35,086 --> 00:13:37,086
Yes, that's right.

202
00:13:37,086 --> 00:13:40,086
The two of them will be very happy about it.

203
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:42,086
I'm going with you out of town.

204
00:13:42,086 --> 00:13:44,086
You should finally see green meadows.

205
00:13:44,086 --> 00:13:47,086
Poor Clara has never been out in nature before.

206
00:13:47,086 --> 00:13:50,086
And Heidi may be comforted by that.

207
00:13:54,094 --> 00:13:57,414
La la la la la la la la la.

208
00:13:57,414 --> 00:14:01,414
La la la la la la la.

209
00:14:01,414 --> 00:14:04,414
A picnic where?

210
00:14:04,414 --> 00:14:05,414
In the forest?

211
00:14:05,414 --> 00:14:07,414
Yes, of course. Only if you feel like it.

212
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:09,414
I know exactly where to go.

213
00:14:09,414 --> 00:14:10,414
It's beautiful there.

214
00:14:10,414 --> 00:14:12,414
I used to go there every Sunday

215
00:14:12,414 --> 00:14:14,414
when I was a little girl and had a boyfriend.

216
00:14:14,414 --> 00:14:16,414
Later your grandfather Clara became your boyfriend.

217
00:14:16,414 --> 00:14:20,414
We often walked through the meadows there for hours.

218
00:14:20,414 --> 00:14:23,414
And there is a stream there with sparkling fish.

219
00:14:23,604 --> 00:14:26,064
Please let us go right away, Grandmother.

220
00:14:26,064 --> 00:14:27,724
Right away? Without preparation?

221
00:14:27,724 --> 00:14:30,264
Then let us quickly prepare everything.

222
00:14:30,264 --> 00:14:32,484
Maybe we'll see butterflies there.

223
00:14:32,484 --> 00:14:36,264
I would like to go with you, but I can't.

224
00:14:36,264 --> 00:14:37,644
Oh, really?

225
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:40,184
Yes, I will make sure that it works.

226
00:14:40,184 --> 00:14:42,184
We take the wheelchair and Sebastian with us.

227
00:14:42,184 --> 00:14:45,604
And when we get small, we all fit into the carriage.

228
00:14:48,104 --> 00:14:49,104
But Clara...

229
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:52,166
Why are you so restless? What are you afraid of?

230
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:55,166
We're going on a trip to the green and tonight we're back home.

231
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:59,166
You don't want to sit in this dark room all your life, do you?

232
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:02,166
You have to go outside to the fresh air.

233
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,166
That's probably not good for me again.

234
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:07,166
Yes, it is. Fresh air has not harmed anyone yet.

235
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:10,166
It is much more unhealthy to sit in here all the time.

236
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:11,166
Do you know squirrels?

237
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:14,166
Not yet, but I would like to see them.

238
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,166
Then come with me. You will see them outside.

239
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,166
They jump around in the trees.

240
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,166
Why?

241
00:15:19,225 --> 00:15:21,425
Okay, I'll go with you.

242
00:15:21,425 --> 00:15:23,425
Hurray! We're going!

243
00:15:23,425 --> 00:15:28,425
And now, since we agreed, we have to make a promise.

244
00:15:28,425 --> 00:15:30,425
With crossed arms?

245
00:15:30,425 --> 00:15:32,425
Yes, with crossed arms.

246
00:15:32,425 --> 00:15:36,425
We all go or no one goes.

247
00:15:36,425 --> 00:15:39,425
If one stays here, everyone stays here.

248
00:15:39,425 --> 00:15:43,425
The promise is a promise and will not be broken.

249
00:15:44,425 --> 00:15:46,425
I'll go with you.

250
00:15:46,425 --> 00:15:48,425
Yes, we all go out of town together.

251
00:15:49,001 --> 00:15:52,001
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

252
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:57,001
I go into my room and meet the preparations. Hooray!

253
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:21,399
Let's go!

254
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,399
Hooray!

255
00:16:42,995 --> 00:16:44,995
I will take full responsibility.

256
00:16:44,995 --> 00:16:46,995
What you are doing is a criminal offence.

257
00:16:46,995 --> 00:16:48,995
Mrs. Clara must stay at home in her wheelchair.

258
00:16:48,995 --> 00:16:51,995
You forget that the child is not healthy.

259
00:16:51,995 --> 00:16:52,995
I see.

260
00:16:53,995 --> 00:16:54,995
Nonsense.

261
00:16:54,995 --> 00:16:56,995
You make me very nervous with your speech.

262
00:16:56,995 --> 00:16:59,995
How am I supposed to find my sunscreen if you scream all the time?

263
00:16:59,995 --> 00:17:02,995
Why do you always have to see everything from the bad side, Mrs. Rottenmeier?

264
00:17:02,995 --> 00:17:04,995
What harm is there?

265
00:17:05,177 --> 00:17:07,977
You don't know if it's a shame or not. Clara is very sensitive.

266
00:17:07,977 --> 00:17:11,577
She must not strain herself and not get pulled. I am responsible for you.

267
00:17:11,577 --> 00:17:14,777
I have good news for you, Mrs. Rottenmeier.

268
00:17:14,777 --> 00:17:19,577
My gloves have just been found again, which I was looking for this morning.

269
00:17:22,977 --> 00:17:24,977
May I give you an advice?

270
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:28,377
I knew something for you that you could use very well.

271
00:17:28,377 --> 00:17:32,377
Just a little bit of humor. What do you think of it?

272
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,489
Mrs. Sesemann.

273
00:17:34,489 --> 00:17:37,869
I'm shocked. I'm employed in this house.

274
00:17:37,869 --> 00:17:41,869
As a teacher and as a respectable person and not as a tramp.

275
00:17:46,707 --> 00:17:50,707
A little hamper wouldn't hurt you at all.

276
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:02,707
Are you finished?

277
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:03,707
Yes.

278
00:18:04,728 --> 00:18:07,728
Clara, you look pretty, my child.

279
00:18:07,728 --> 00:18:09,728
I'm looking forward to it, Mother.

280
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Oh my!

281
00:18:22,648 --> 00:18:24,648
Have you fed the horses?

282
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:28,648
Yes.

283
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,380
Sarah, here!

284
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:27,380
Clara, we're here! We're here!

285
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,380
Clara, we're here! We're here, Clara!

286
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,380
Hurray! We're here! Hurray!

287
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,380
Come on, get out!

288
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,016
There are a lot of pretty...

289
00:20:53,016 --> 00:20:56,016
Plum, the whole meadow is full. Do you want me to show it to you?

290
00:20:56,016 --> 00:20:57,016
Yes, please send me there.

291
00:20:57,016 --> 00:20:58,016
Hold on!

292
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:04,789
We are now preparing the food.

293
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:07,789
Don't drive too far away, you two be careful!

294
00:21:07,789 --> 00:21:09,789
Yes, we are!

295
00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:12,789
Is this peaceful here.

296
00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:15,789
I am glad that I brought the two of them here.

297
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:28,789
Thank you, Heidi.

298
00:21:29,597 --> 00:21:31,597
But they are beautiful.

299
00:21:33,597 --> 00:21:35,597
Beautiful, beautiful.

300
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:40,597
I never want to go back to the city.

301
00:21:49,597 --> 00:21:51,597
Shall we go over there?

302
00:21:59,597 --> 00:22:01,597
Yes.

303
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:08,257
Heidi, look! What is that?

304
00:22:08,257 --> 00:22:10,257
A sea beetle.

305
00:22:10,257 --> 00:22:13,757
But it has pretty dots, round dots.

306
00:22:13,757 --> 00:22:14,757
Yes.

307
00:22:16,757 --> 00:22:18,757
And up there, birds.

308
00:22:25,501 --> 00:22:29,501
If they fly a little higher, they have disappeared into the clouds.

309
00:22:33,501 --> 00:22:36,501
Clara was never as happy as today.

310
00:22:36,501 --> 00:22:41,501
For a moment she even forgot that she could not walk and had to sit in the
wheelchair.

311
00:22:41,501 --> 00:22:46,501
She hoped with all her heart that this day would never come to an end.

312
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:52,501
For Clara, every flower, every butterfly was a new adventure.

313
00:22:52,501 --> 00:22:54,851
She could not be satisfied with everything.

314
00:22:54,851 --> 00:22:58,351
Sebastian and Johann also knew how to enjoy the afternoon.

315
00:22:58,351 --> 00:23:03,351
But Heidi was the most overbearing. She ran and jumped like at home in the
mountains.

316
00:23:03,351 --> 00:23:07,351
And when the sun slowly approached the horizon and it was time to go home,

317
00:23:07,351 --> 00:23:10,851
the two fell asleep as soon as they sat in the carriage.

318
00:23:10,851 --> 00:23:14,351
Tired, but very, very happy.

319
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:18,351
Unfortunately, Clara was a little too tired for this day.

320
00:23:18,351 --> 00:23:22,351
She didn't feel well at all after coming home in the evening.

321
00:23:22,351 --> 00:23:23,283
But...

322
00:23:23,283 --> 00:23:26,483
That's what we want to tell you in our next story.

323
00:23:27,369 --> 00:23:55,369
Heidi, Heidi, your world are the mountains, Heidi, Heidi, because up here you
are at home, Heidi, Heidi, come home, find your happiness, come back home.

324
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:58,760
Thank you for watching.
