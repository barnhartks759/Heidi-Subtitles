1
00:00:02,406 --> 00:00:17,406
Holadio

2
00:00:17,406 --> 00:00:28,406
Heidi, Heidi, your world are the mountains.

3
00:00:28,406 --> 00:00:36,406
Heidi, Heidi, because up here you are at home.

4
00:00:36,406 --> 00:00:44,406
Dark fir trees, green meadows in the sunshine.

5
00:00:44,406 --> 00:00:52,406
Heidi, Heidi, you need to be happy.

6
00:01:05,406 --> 00:01:11,406
Heidi, Heidi, come home.

7
00:01:11,406 --> 00:01:13,406
Find your happiness.

8
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,406
Come home.

9
00:01:14,406 --> 00:01:18,406
Come back again.

10
00:01:19,386 --> 00:01:24,386
Heidi lived for a week in the house of the Sesemann family in Frankfurt.

11
00:01:24,386 --> 00:01:30,386
She was a lot with Clara together, took part in the lessons and learned to get
Mrs. Rottenmeier out of the way.

12
00:01:30,386 --> 00:01:35,386
The others seemed as if Heidi had found her new life.

13
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:40,386
I just don't want to believe it. No bird likes to be locked up in a cage.

14
00:01:40,386 --> 00:01:42,386
Hansi grew up in the cage.

15
00:01:42,386 --> 00:01:47,386
Just like me. I've never come out of the house either. I'm here at home.

16
00:01:49,386 --> 00:01:51,834
The next morning.

17
00:01:51,834 --> 00:01:54,834
No reason to sigh.

18
00:01:54,834 --> 00:01:58,834
I'm always sitting here in my room, but I've seen a lot anyway.

19
00:01:58,834 --> 00:02:00,834
On maps and pictures.

20
00:02:02,834 --> 00:02:05,834
I know all the animals from these pictures.

21
00:02:06,834 --> 00:02:08,834
How cute.

22
00:02:09,834 --> 00:02:11,834
Do you really like the kittens?

23
00:02:11,834 --> 00:02:13,834
Yes, I like them very much.

24
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:15,834
Then I'll give it to you. You can keep it.

25
00:02:15,834 --> 00:02:18,480
I can keep it? You'll give it to me?

26
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,480
Why not? But hide it from Mrs. Rottenmeier. She just can't stand animals.

27
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:28,480
That's why she got so excited when I brought the mice from the cellar with me.

28
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,480
I'd rather hide it well.

29
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,480
There was another picture I wanted to show you. Yes, that one. Does your house
look like that?

30
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:44,480
No. We don't have a house. We have a hut. A small hut made of wood with fir
trees in front of the door and a big fireplace in our living room.

31
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,888
Really? Yes.

32
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,888
And in front of the hut, right next to the door, is a wooden bench.

33
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:57,050
Phew, the stool is quite heavy.

34
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,050
The stool is the bench, on which I sit every morning.

35
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:03,050
And here sits the grandfather and notices the goats, Schwendi and Berli.

36
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,050
And sometimes I help him with it. I can notice.

37
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:09,050
Don't worry, Schwendi, I won't hurt you.

38
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,050
That's how good it is, good boy.

39
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,050
Schwendi always has a lot of milk.

40
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:16,050
Goat milk is healthy, you don't believe how good it tastes.

41
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,050
I'm thirsty.

42
00:03:28,873 --> 00:03:31,873
What's going on now? Why are you screaming?

43
00:03:31,873 --> 00:03:33,873
But that was Joseph!

44
00:03:33,873 --> 00:03:35,873
Oh, of course!

45
00:03:35,873 --> 00:03:39,873
Peter is coming with the goats! Joseph wanted to tell me that!

46
00:03:39,873 --> 00:03:41,873
Peter, hurry up!

47
00:03:45,873 --> 00:03:48,873
Stop! Watch out! You'll break your legs!

48
00:03:49,513 --> 00:03:51,513
Schnucki, you shouldn't always run around like that.

49
00:03:51,513 --> 00:03:53,513
That's Peter you're copying now.

50
00:03:53,513 --> 00:03:56,513
Schnucki barks at him. He always comes running to me.

51
00:03:56,513 --> 00:03:58,513
Holla, holla, off you go!

52
00:03:58,513 --> 00:04:00,513
Again and again, Schnucki.

53
00:04:03,513 --> 00:04:04,513
Is the mountain so steep?

54
00:04:04,513 --> 00:04:07,513
Well, what do you think? You have to climb quite a bit before you get there.

55
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:09,513
So, now he's arrived.

56
00:04:09,513 --> 00:04:10,513
Ah, good.

57
00:04:10,513 --> 00:04:13,513
Peter always stands far away. He never dares to go into the hut.

58
00:04:13,513 --> 00:04:14,513
Why?

59
00:04:14,513 --> 00:04:16,513
He's afraid of my grandfather.

60
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:19,359
Good morning, goat general.

61
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,359
Good morning, good morning.

62
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:23,359
Good morning.

63
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:27,359
Yes, good morning, Almöhi.

64
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:29,359
Why Almöhi?

65
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:32,359
Oh, Mr. Peter and the people down in the village, they call my grandfather that.

66
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:35,359
Good morning, goat general.

67
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:37,359
Good morning, good morning, good morning.

68
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:40,359
Did you have breakfast today?

69
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:42,359
Yes, but not enough.

70
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:49,359
Hurray!

71
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:51,359
We live in the mountains.

72
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:53,359
We dance with the dwarfs.

73
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:56,359
We talk with the trees and fly in the dreams.

74
00:04:56,359 --> 00:04:58,359
Hurray, hurray, hurray, hurray.

75
00:04:58,359 --> 00:05:00,359
We don't live in Africa.

76
00:05:00,359 --> 00:05:03,359
We live in the mountains and dance with the dwarfs.

77
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,359
Sing along, Klara. It always starts from the beginning.

78
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:07,113
We live in...

79
00:05:07,113 --> 00:05:09,113
Ciao! I can't sing!

80
00:05:09,113 --> 00:05:11,113
The Grandfather and Joseph!

81
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:16,857
Good morning, General Siegen.

82
00:05:16,857 --> 00:05:17,857
Good morning, Admiral.

83
00:05:17,857 --> 00:05:19,857
That's what they say every morning.

84
00:05:21,857 --> 00:05:22,857
Did you have breakfast today?

85
00:05:22,857 --> 00:05:23,857
Not enough.

86
00:05:25,141 --> 00:05:27,181
Let's go! Hurry!

87
00:05:27,321 --> 00:05:29,321
Peter!

88
00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:38,921
Wait for me!

89
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,921
Peter, Snooki, Swenli, Berli.

90
00:05:42,921 --> 00:05:44,921
Peter!

91
00:05:44,921 --> 00:05:46,921
Wait!

92
00:05:46,921 --> 00:05:48,921
Where is Peter?

93
00:05:48,921 --> 00:05:50,921
Where is he?

94
00:05:50,921 --> 00:05:52,921
Where is Peter?

95
00:05:52,921 --> 00:05:54,921
Peter! Wait!

96
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Oh, that was a nice game. That was fun. You can whistle.

97
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,600
Yes. Peter taught me. It's very easy.

98
00:06:19,096 --> 00:06:23,096
That never works the first time. You have to practice a lot first.

99
00:06:31,384 --> 00:06:35,384
Listen, he whistled with you.

100
00:06:47,768 --> 00:06:51,368
Of course, that's what I could have thought. The nobility.

101
00:06:51,368 --> 00:06:54,368
I just tried to teach Clara how to whistle on her fingers.

102
00:06:54,368 --> 00:06:59,368
Calm down! How can you dare to let Clara whistle on her fingers?

103
00:06:59,368 --> 00:07:04,368
It was my fault. I wanted Heidi to tell me everything about her mountains.

104
00:07:04,368 --> 00:07:07,868
What about the mountains? What is there to say about that?

105
00:07:07,868 --> 00:07:10,368
Put your noses in the school books.

106
00:07:10,368 --> 00:07:14,768
But Heidi's story was nice. I liked it better than the boring books.

107
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,768
I know better stories.

108
00:07:16,798 --> 00:07:19,798
Of the goats, and the dog, and the grandfather?

109
00:07:19,798 --> 00:07:21,798
I want to hear all the stories you know.

110
00:07:21,798 --> 00:07:22,798
Goats and dogs?

111
00:07:22,798 --> 00:07:25,798
Yes, and wild goats, and sometimes even an eagle.

112
00:07:28,798 --> 00:07:29,798
No, no, no!

113
00:07:29,798 --> 00:07:30,798
But...

114
00:07:31,798 --> 00:07:34,798
I wish that you stop wasting your time.

115
00:07:34,798 --> 00:07:38,798
No more stories of this kind in this house, understood?

116
00:07:38,798 --> 00:07:43,798
Miss Clara comes from a good house, and I will not let her education be ruined
by you.

117
00:07:43,798 --> 00:07:44,798
Understood?

118
00:07:46,798 --> 00:07:47,798
Yes.

119
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:53,168
I'm sorry, Heidi. You were scolded because of me.

120
00:07:53,168 --> 00:07:56,168
But I wanted you to tell me.

121
00:07:56,168 --> 00:07:59,168
I want to know what the grandfather is doing now.

122
00:07:59,168 --> 00:08:02,168
And Peter and the blind grandmother.

123
00:08:02,168 --> 00:08:05,168
Do you have a home in the mountains, Heidi?

124
00:08:05,168 --> 00:08:08,168
If you look out the window, you can only see stones and houses.

125
00:08:10,168 --> 00:08:14,168
Why don't you go up to the tower? There's a window and you can see out there.

126
00:08:14,168 --> 00:08:16,798
Maybe you can see more than just houses from there.

127
00:08:16,798 --> 00:08:19,398
And how do I get there? I don't even know where the tower is.

128
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:21,398
Always the stairs up, then you'll get there.

129
00:08:21,398 --> 00:08:23,898
Thank you, Clara. Maybe I can see the mountains from there.

130
00:08:23,898 --> 00:08:27,298
But be careful. Be careful that Mr. Rottenmeier doesn't catch you there.

131
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:30,198
I'll be careful. I don't want to be scolded again today.

132
00:08:30,198 --> 00:08:33,798
Then please come back right away and tell me what you saw from up there.

133
00:08:43,798 --> 00:08:45,048
Psst! Psst!

134
00:08:45,048 --> 00:08:47,048
Pssst, the animal doesn't get me!

135
00:08:47,048 --> 00:08:51,048
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...

136
00:08:51,048 --> 00:08:53,048
Even higher!

137
00:08:55,048 --> 00:08:58,048
8, 11, 13, 17...

138
00:08:58,048 --> 00:09:00,048
1, 2, 3...

139
00:09:06,983 --> 00:09:08,983
Thanks for watching!

140
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,715
Ow!

141
00:09:39,715 --> 00:09:54,715
Help!

142
00:09:54,715 --> 00:09:56,715
Don't tell anyone!

143
00:09:56,715 --> 00:09:58,715
Do you really want that, Heini?

144
00:09:58,715 --> 00:10:00,715
Yes.

145
00:10:18,823 --> 00:10:21,823
What can you see from the other side?

146
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,823
I don't know what you mean.

147
00:10:26,823 --> 00:10:28,823
Can you see the mountains from there?

148
00:10:28,823 --> 00:10:30,823
The house is not high enough for that.

149
00:10:30,823 --> 00:10:32,823
You probably have to climb to a higher building.

150
00:10:32,823 --> 00:10:36,823
Good. But where do I find a house that is high enough, Sebastian?

151
00:10:36,823 --> 00:10:39,823
Well, certainly a church tower would be sufficient.

152
00:10:39,823 --> 00:10:41,823
Is there one in Frankfurt?

153
00:10:41,823 --> 00:10:43,823
No city without a church tower.

154
00:10:43,823 --> 00:10:45,823
At least I don't know one without one.

155
00:10:45,823 --> 00:10:46,823
Please.

156
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:54,829
Um, there should also be a clock tower could also be enough, or the roof of the
park, or a flag mast, but I still miss that one.

157
00:10:54,829 --> 00:10:57,829
But I think the church tower would be the best in your case.

158
00:10:59,829 --> 00:11:00,829
But why...

159
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,829
Heidi, Heidi!

160
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:06,829
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

161
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:15,959
Finally in the fresh air!

166
00:12:50,614 --> 00:12:52,614
It can't be Sebastian's idea.

167
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,710
There's apple on the table!

168
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,086
Where's the tower?

169
00:13:20,086 --> 00:13:23,086
I saw him very clearly. He was there.

170
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,970
Strange.

171
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,970
Oh!

172
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,970
Well, what are you?

173
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,970
Why are you snoring?

174
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,970
Then, the devil must have heard you!

175
00:14:20,182 --> 00:14:23,982
I like my music. I wish I had a music box like that.

176
00:14:24,182 --> 00:14:25,382
Then pay something.

177
00:14:25,582 --> 00:14:27,182
Why should I pay something?

178
00:14:27,382 --> 00:14:28,982
Everyone has to pay.

179
00:14:30,182 --> 00:14:33,182
You know what's funny? The church tower has disappeared.

180
00:14:33,382 --> 00:14:35,582
So if you can laugh about it, I'm sorry.

181
00:14:35,782 --> 00:14:39,182
Actually, I can't laugh about it either, but I'm looking for it so much.

182
00:14:39,382 --> 00:14:41,382
What do you pay if I show you one?

183
00:14:41,582 --> 00:14:43,782
I know where one is and I can take you there.

184
00:14:43,982 --> 00:14:45,782
But then you have to pay me something.

185
00:14:45,982 --> 00:14:47,582
Yes, that's good.

186

187
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:54,510
Do you want this?

188
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:57,510
What am I supposed to do with this dull picture? You can keep it.

189
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,510
Why don't you like it?

190
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:02,510
Good, then I can keep it. My friend Clara gave it to me.

191
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:05,510
Unfortunately, I don't have anything else.

192
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,510
No money?

193
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:09,510
No, I've never had any money in my hand.

194
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,510
Aha.

195
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,510
But I think Clara has a lot of money.

196
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:15,510
If I ask her, she'll definitely give you something.

197
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,163
Good. How much?

198
00:15:17,163 --> 00:15:19,163
As much as you want, Clara, isn't that nice?

199
00:15:19,163 --> 00:15:21,163
Come with me, I'll show you where it is.

200
00:15:22,513 --> 00:15:24,513
I'll show you where it is.

201
00:15:52,513 --> 00:15:54,513
I'll show you where it is.

202
00:15:57,701 --> 00:15:59,701
It's closed.

203
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:02,801
We'll get in somehow.

204
00:16:06,601 --> 00:16:08,601
Hello!

205
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:10,601
Is anybody there?

206
00:16:18,117 --> 00:16:22,117
Such a big house can't be empty. Someone has to be there.

207
00:16:22,117 --> 00:16:24,117
Don't bother, there's no one there.

208
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:27,117
At Pia's, there's no one there. Don't forget my money!

209
00:16:27,117 --> 00:16:28,117
No!

210
00:16:37,117 --> 00:16:38,117
Hopla!

211
00:16:39,781 --> 00:16:41,781
Come on, Trant, you're bigger than me.

212
00:16:41,781 --> 00:16:43,781
Leave it.

213
00:16:43,781 --> 00:16:46,781
There's no one there anyway, and if there is, they won't let us in.

214
00:16:46,781 --> 00:16:50,781
But if I ask, I just want to see down from the tower.

215
00:16:50,781 --> 00:16:52,781
Why shouldn't I do that?

216
00:16:52,781 --> 00:16:54,781
Oh, that can take some time.

217
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:58,781
Hopefully you won't forget my twenty pence.

218
00:17:00,781 --> 00:17:02,781
I don't want any more.

219
00:17:03,781 --> 00:17:05,781
How much? I didn't understand.

220
00:17:05,781 --> 00:17:07,781
Exactly twenty pence.

221
00:17:09,781 --> 00:17:11,781
Huh?

222
00:17:11,877 --> 00:17:15,877
There must have been those lousy boys at the bell again.

223
00:17:15,877 --> 00:17:17,877
Was that you?

224
00:17:17,877 --> 00:17:21,877
Good day. May I climb on your tower? I want to see the mountains.

225
00:17:21,877 --> 00:17:24,877
What do you want? That's impossible.

226
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:28,877
You call me out because you want to climb on my tower?

227
00:17:28,877 --> 00:17:30,877
Has someone sent you?

228
00:17:33,877 --> 00:17:36,877
So, you want to climb on my tower?

229
00:17:37,381 --> 00:17:41,381
You are mistaken. I won't let you take me on your arm.

230
00:17:41,381 --> 00:17:43,381
Go on, do it so you can come home. But quickly!

231
00:17:43,381 --> 00:17:46,381
The world has not yet experienced that. Will climb the tower.

232
00:17:46,381 --> 00:17:50,381
No! Stop! I would like to climb the tower so much!

233
00:17:50,381 --> 00:17:55,381
Please! I would like to know if you can see mountains and meadows from there.

234
00:17:55,381 --> 00:17:57,381
Here you can see houses.

235
00:17:58,004 --> 00:18:01,004
Yes, tell me, do you mean that seriously?

236
00:18:01,004 --> 00:18:06,004
Of course I mean that. There are only houses and streets here and there are
stones everywhere.

237
00:18:06,004 --> 00:18:11,004
Yes, you know, the stairs are not that easy for such a little girl.

238
00:18:11,004 --> 00:18:13,004
Oh, I can do that.

239
00:18:13,004 --> 00:18:16,004
Hold on, you can't do it alone.

240
00:18:16,004 --> 00:18:18,004
Yes, I don't need help.

241
00:18:28,004 --> 00:18:30,004
Yes, I can do that.

242
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:39,060
But child, why are you running so fearfully?

243
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,060
Yes, tell me.

244
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:17,852
Why are you still standing? You're right, you just have to climb up the ladder.

245
00:19:17,852 --> 00:19:19,852
Am I up then? Thank you!

246
00:19:21,852 --> 00:19:24,852
For heaven's sake, not so fast, be careful!

247
00:19:33,652 --> 00:19:35,652
Well, wait a minute, I'll help you.

248
00:19:37,652 --> 00:19:38,652
So.

249
00:19:40,652 --> 00:19:43,652
Yes, what do you say? Isn't that a nice view?

250
00:19:53,652 --> 00:19:55,652
But where are the mountains?

251
00:20:00,652 --> 00:20:02,388
I want to go down, thank you.

252
00:20:02,388 --> 00:20:04,388
Oh, over there.

253
00:20:04,388 --> 00:20:06,388
May I look down from this side?

254
00:20:06,388 --> 00:20:08,388
Of course.

255
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:20,020
Where are the mountains, the meadows and the meadows?

256
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,020
You wanted to see the mountains, but they don't exist here in Frankfurt.

257
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:29,020
And no meadows, and no beech trees, and no flowers, and no birds, and no goats.

258
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:36,020
We don't have goats here, but we have flowers, meadows and beech trees in front
of the city, also very beautiful.

259
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,020
Yes.

260
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:42,020
Today it is a bit desolate, but on a clear day you can also see a few mountains.

261
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,020
Not as high as the Alps.

262
00:20:44,026 --> 00:20:48,786
But the Taunus is also beautiful. In any case, it is enough for me to climb up.

263
00:20:48,786 --> 00:20:52,466
Well, and our Main back there, is it nothing?

264
00:20:52,466 --> 00:20:55,266
Not as beautiful as my mountains.

265
00:20:55,266 --> 00:21:01,386
There is snow on the peaks, and the sun shines, and the firs smell.

266
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:05,586
If you look down from a mountain, you can see green meadows.

267
00:21:05,586 --> 00:21:08,585
But you all don't understand that.

268
00:21:08,585 --> 00:21:15,585
Sometimes there is an eagle in the sky, and when you are very quiet, you can see
the marmots and the storks.

269
00:21:18,585 --> 00:21:27,585
Mrs. Rottenmeier doesn't even know what that is. I can't even tell her about it,
and neither can Peter and the goats.

270
00:21:28,585 --> 00:21:35,585
How should the tower guard know what Heidi thought? He meant well with her. He
wanted to comfort her.

271
00:21:35,913 --> 00:21:53,713
But how should he know that his little guest had a home-sickness, after the
rustle of the tall green fir trees, after the fresh scent of the mountain
meadows, and after an old grandfather who was alone somewhere in the mountains
and had just as much home-sickness after the little girl as the girl after him.

272
00:21:57,313 --> 00:22:00,513
Come, child. We have to go down again. I have to lock the door.

273
00:22:05,913 --> 00:22:07,913
To be continued

274
00:22:16,931 --> 00:22:20,931
Come on, it's easier to get down than to get up.

275
00:22:25,763 --> 00:22:29,763
So are you coming soon or not?

276
00:22:29,763 --> 00:22:32,763
I told you I had to lock you up.

277
00:22:47,779 --> 00:22:51,779
It took a while until Heidi discovered the kittens.

278
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:53,779
You don't have to tell it to you first.

279
00:22:53,779 --> 00:22:59,779
You know them well enough to know that all sadness was gone.

280
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:02,779
Of course Heidi took the little cats home.

281
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:05,779
Surely something unthinkable of her.

282
00:23:05,779 --> 00:23:09,779
The Mr. Candidate and Mrs. Rottenmeier with cats in a room?

283
00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:12,779
Not to imagine what could happen there.

284
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:16,201
Of course Heidi tried to hide the cats.

285
00:23:16,201 --> 00:23:18,201
But it's not that easy either.

286
00:23:18,201 --> 00:23:20,201
Little, lively cats

287
00:23:20,201 --> 00:23:23,201
can't be locked in a sewing box all day long

288
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:25,201
without being noticed.

289
00:23:25,903 --> 00:23:53,903
Heidi, Heidi, your world are the mountains. Heidi, Heidi, because up here you
are at home. Heidi, Heidi, come home, find your happiness, come back home.

290
00:23:55,903 --> 00:23:56,280
