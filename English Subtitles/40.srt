00:00:00,634 --> 00:00:02,634
Welcome to my channel!

2
00:00:02,634 --> 00:00:03,494
Today I will show you how to make a

3
00:00:03,494 --> 00:00:17,874
Heidi. Heidi, your world is the mountains. Heidi. Heidi, because I too am a
Heidi.

4
00:00:17,874 --> 00:00:27,874
Heide, Heide, your world are the mountains.

5
00:00:27,874 --> 00:00:35,874
Heide, Heide, because up here you are at home.

6
00:00:35,874 --> 00:00:43,874
Dark fir trees, green meadows in the sunshine.

7
00:00:43,874 --> 00:00:51,874
Heide, Heide, you need to be happy.

8
00:01:05,874 --> 00:01:11,874
Heide, Heide, come home.

9
00:01:11,874 --> 00:01:13,874
Find your happiness.

10
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:18,874
Come back again.

11
00:01:43,874 --> 00:01:48,874
Come back to me.

12
00:01:48,874 --> 00:01:51,874
Heide, Heide, he's getting up.

13
00:01:51,874 --> 00:01:55,874
Heide, Heide, get up.

14
00:01:55,874 --> 00:02:01,874
Heide, Heide, you need to find your happiness.

15
00:02:01,874 --> 00:02:06,874
Heide, Heide, you need to be happy.

16
00:02:06,874 --> 00:02:09,874
Heide, Heide, you need to be happy.

17
00:02:09,874 --> 00:02:11,874
Heide, Heide, he's getting up.

18
00:02:11,874 --> 00:02:13,874
We're going back home. We're going up to the hut.

19
00:02:14,874 --> 00:02:15,874
Heidi, where are you staying?

20
00:02:16,874 --> 00:02:17,874
I'll be right back, Grandfather.

21
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:20,874
Well, good night.

22
00:02:21,874 --> 00:02:22,874
Good night.

23
00:02:23,874 --> 00:02:24,874
Good night.

24
00:02:25,874 --> 00:02:26,874
Good night.

25
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,450
Well, then stay away from me. I'll go without you.

26
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,950
But it's about time.

27
00:02:33,978 --> 00:02:40,978
After Geißlein was ready to join the group, Heidi and her grandfather could
finally break up.

28
00:02:40,978 --> 00:02:42,978
So you're going up to the hut again now?

29
00:02:42,978 --> 00:02:45,978
Yes, of course! It's spring! Goodbye!

30
00:02:45,978 --> 00:02:47,978
Are you going down again next winter?

31
00:02:47,978 --> 00:02:50,978
I think so. In any case, the grandfather said it earlier.

32
00:02:50,978 --> 00:02:51,978
One moment, Heidi!

33
00:02:54,978 --> 00:02:56,978
Here, a few places to go.

34
00:02:56,978 --> 00:02:58,978
Oh, thank you very much! Goodbye!

35
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:00,978
Goodbye, Heidi.

36
00:03:00,978 --> 00:03:02,978
Don't you need to go to school anymore?

37
00:03:02,978 --> 00:03:03,813
Of course!

38
00:03:03,813 --> 00:03:05,813
Goodbye!

39
00:03:05,813 --> 00:03:07,813
She's in a good mood.

40
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:11,813
You know, it was really nice down there, but I'm glad we're finally coming home.

41
00:03:14,813 --> 00:03:17,813
There you are again, Grandmother. You're coming back.

42
00:03:17,813 --> 00:03:18,813
Yes?

43
00:03:18,813 --> 00:03:20,813
Good morning!

44
00:03:21,813 --> 00:03:24,813
We're coming home again. Good day!

45
00:03:24,813 --> 00:03:25,813
Good day, Heidi.

46
00:03:25,813 --> 00:03:29,813
There, the cookies were given to me down in the village. Take them, please.

47
00:03:29,813 --> 00:03:31,813
No, thank you very much, Heidi.

48
00:03:31,877 --> 00:03:33,977
You keep them. You got them.

49
00:03:33,977 --> 00:03:36,577
Oh, what? Keep them? Where is Peter?

50
00:03:36,577 --> 00:03:39,277
He's collecting wood. Maybe you can see him somewhere in the forest.

51
00:03:39,277 --> 00:03:42,277
Maybe. I have to go now. Goodbye.

52
00:03:42,277 --> 00:03:45,777
See you soon. Peter will be happy to see you again.

53
00:03:54,477 --> 00:03:55,055
There!

54
00:03:55,055 --> 00:03:59,055
Please, Grandfather! Come on, Kaislein, quickly!

55
00:03:59,995 --> 00:04:01,995
Kaislein, we're at home!

56
00:04:07,995 --> 00:04:09,995
Kaislein? Kaislein!

57
00:04:11,995 --> 00:04:13,995
Kaislein!

58
00:04:13,995 --> 00:04:15,995
Oh, he's half.

59
00:04:17,995 --> 00:04:19,995
You slipped.

60
00:04:29,995 --> 00:04:31,995
Kaislein!

61
00:04:51,995 --> 00:04:53,995
Ah, my feathers.

62
00:04:59,995 --> 00:05:01,995
Kaislein!

63
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:05,299
Do you hear them rustling? They say good day!

64
00:05:05,307 --> 00:05:07,307
Did you hear the tannins? They're rustling!

65
00:05:09,307 --> 00:05:11,307
Yes, at home!

66
00:05:17,307 --> 00:05:19,307
Is everything okay up there too?

67
00:05:35,307 --> 00:05:37,307
Yes!

68
00:05:45,307 --> 00:05:47,307
Done!

69
00:05:47,307 --> 00:05:49,307
Nice!

70
00:05:57,307 --> 00:05:59,307
I like it even better!

71
00:06:04,484 --> 00:06:09,484
Miss Clara, what about the meat? Is it too tough?

72
00:06:09,484 --> 00:06:11,484
I'm not hungry. I don't like it.

73
00:06:11,484 --> 00:06:13,484
What does that mean?

74
00:06:13,484 --> 00:06:17,484
What kind of strange behavior is that, Miss Clara?

75
00:06:17,484 --> 00:06:21,484
You have to eat three times a day, regularly.

76
00:06:21,484 --> 00:06:23,484
It's good for your health.

77
00:06:29,732 --> 00:06:33,732
Dear Clara, everyone wants you to come visit us.

78
00:06:33,732 --> 00:06:36,732
Grandfather, Joseph, Schweli, Berli, Geißlein.

79
00:06:36,732 --> 00:06:39,732
We would like to show you how beautiful it is here.

80
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:42,732
I have already seen three eagles this spring.

81
00:06:43,732 --> 00:06:47,732
Peter and I usually lie in the meadow and sleep in the sun.

82
00:06:47,732 --> 00:06:51,732
I have grown a bit again and have become completely brown.

83
00:06:52,732 --> 00:06:54,732
Yes, please.

84
00:06:54,938 --> 00:06:58,438
Can't you sleep? I saw through the window that you still have some light.

85
00:06:58,438 --> 00:07:00,438
I can't sleep yet.

86
00:07:00,438 --> 00:07:03,938
Would you like me to make you warm milk or a glass of sugar water?

87
00:07:03,938 --> 00:07:06,438
No, that's not necessary. I sleep like that too.

88
00:07:06,438 --> 00:07:08,438
Good night, Mrs. Rottenmeier.

89
00:07:11,938 --> 00:07:16,438
Your grandmother was right. If you were here with us, you would quickly become
healthy.

90
00:07:16,438 --> 00:07:19,438
And I know that you like it here too.

91
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:22,438
Do you remember our afternoon in the forest?

92
00:07:22,438 --> 00:07:25,438
You liked the sun so much back then.

93
00:07:33,508 --> 00:07:34,508
...

94
00:07:34,508 --> 00:07:35,508
...

95
00:07:35,508 --> 00:07:36,508
...

96
00:07:36,508 --> 00:07:37,508
...

97
00:07:37,508 --> 00:07:38,508
...

98
00:07:38,508 --> 00:07:39,508
...

99
00:07:39,508 --> 00:07:40,484
...

100
00:07:40,484 --> 00:07:43,484
And do you know how many flowers there were?

101
00:07:43,484 --> 00:07:50,484
You might not believe me, but there are many, many, many, many thousand more
flowers here.

102
00:07:50,484 --> 00:07:52,484
Sebastian, Sebastian, come!

103
00:07:52,484 --> 00:07:54,484
Yes.

104
00:07:54,484 --> 00:07:55,484
Yes, please.

105
00:07:55,484 --> 00:07:58,484
I have to talk to Mrs. Rottenmeier immediately. Please bring me in.

106
00:07:58,484 --> 00:08:01,484
Of course, Mrs. Clara, gladly.

107
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:08,394
Has the sun gotten too hot for you, Mrs. Clara?

108
00:08:08,394 --> 00:08:11,794
No, but we have to write a letter to my father right away.

109
00:08:11,794 --> 00:08:13,194
Whaaat?

110
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:16,194
Did something special happen?

111
00:08:16,194 --> 00:08:18,394
No, but I have to remind him of something.

112
00:08:18,394 --> 00:08:22,094
He gave me a promise last time, but he probably forgot it.

113
00:08:22,094 --> 00:08:23,394
So?

114
00:08:23,394 --> 00:08:25,094
What kind of promise?

115
00:08:25,094 --> 00:08:27,394
He said I was allowed to go to the mountains.

116
00:08:27,394 --> 00:08:30,394
Did he really promise you that?

117
00:08:30,394 --> 00:08:35,094
Miss Clara, do you want to take me on your arm or how am I supposed to
understand that?

118
00:08:35,094 --> 00:08:39,294
Your father can never have said such nonsense in his life. Never!

119
00:08:39,294 --> 00:08:45,294
Oh yes, when Heidi left her at that time, he promised me that I would be able to
visit you when spring comes again.

120
00:08:45,294 --> 00:08:50,794
And how do you imagine yourself getting there? The mountains are not just on the
other side of Mainz.

121
00:08:50,794 --> 00:08:52,294
I know, I'm not stupid.

122
00:08:52,294 --> 00:08:54,694
What a language, how ordinary.

123
00:08:54,694 --> 00:08:58,494
You should be ordinary to me. I'll write to my father anyway.

124
00:08:58,494 --> 00:09:00,494
Don't talk to me in that tone.

125
00:09:00,528 --> 00:09:03,728
What do you think if we were a little more in shape?

126
00:09:03,728 --> 00:09:05,828
Please think about it, my love.

127
00:09:05,828 --> 00:09:07,228
Sebastian?

128
00:09:07,228 --> 00:09:08,028
Yes, please.

129
00:09:08,028 --> 00:09:09,528
Bring them to your room.

130
00:09:09,528 --> 00:09:11,228
Mrs. Clara wants to think about it.

131
00:09:11,228 --> 00:09:12,228
No.

132
00:09:16,328 --> 00:09:18,328
This is my third one.

133
00:09:20,828 --> 00:09:23,128
Do you think Clara has already received my letter?

134
00:09:23,128 --> 00:09:24,728
I mean the last one, the long one.

135
00:09:24,728 --> 00:09:26,728
You should have had it a week ago.

136
00:09:27,215 --> 00:09:29,215
Hopefully she can read my writing.

137
00:09:29,215 --> 00:09:32,215
Well, I doubt that.

138
00:09:32,215 --> 00:09:35,215
Do you think I should rewrite everything?

139
00:09:35,215 --> 00:09:38,215
No, I didn't mean that seriously.

140
00:09:38,215 --> 00:09:41,215
I'm sure she can read your writing like that.

141
00:09:41,215 --> 00:09:44,215
Then she knows that we invited her to us.

142
00:09:44,215 --> 00:09:48,215
Hopefully she'll come soon. That would be great.

143
00:09:56,569 --> 00:09:58,569
Yes, please.

144
00:10:00,569 --> 00:10:03,569
I've been waiting for you in the dining room for 15 minutes.

145
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:06,569
The soup is already cold.

146
00:10:06,569 --> 00:10:07,569
Should she?

147
00:10:07,569 --> 00:10:11,569
What do you mean, can it be that you just said, should she?

148
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,569
I'll eat again when you write the letter.

149
00:10:14,569 --> 00:10:16,569
So no, that's not to be understood.

150
00:10:16,569 --> 00:10:21,569
You are unwise, Miss Clara, and I have to say it, also undressed.

151
00:10:21,569 --> 00:10:25,569
But you are intelligent enough to know what to do with it.

152
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,591
I know that very well, but I don't care.

153
00:10:28,591 --> 00:10:32,291
I'm shocked. Shocked and very disappointed.

154
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,291
I didn't expect that from you.

155
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,791
I don't care.

156
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:36,791
What do you mean?

157
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:39,291
Don't act as if you didn't understand.

158
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,291
I want you to write the letter.

159
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:44,291
Be reasonable. That's not possible.

160
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:45,291
Why?

161
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,791
It's possible.

162
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:54,791
I won't eat anything until you write to my father.

163
00:10:54,911 --> 00:10:55,911
But...

164
00:11:05,849 --> 00:11:10,849
Well, fine. I'll ask your father to come home. He'll decide for himself.

165
00:11:10,849 --> 00:11:12,849
Unfortunately, I can't bear that responsibility.

166
00:11:12,849 --> 00:11:14,849
Good. Write it down for sure, okay?

167
00:11:14,849 --> 00:11:16,849
Don't change your mind anymore?

168
00:11:16,849 --> 00:11:18,849
Yes, I'll write it down. You've won.

169
00:11:18,849 --> 00:11:20,849
But I'll also write that I'm against it.

170
00:11:20,849 --> 00:11:24,849
Write the letter down for tonight. Then we can send it to you tomorrow.

171
00:11:24,849 --> 00:11:25,849
Thank you.

172
00:11:25,849 --> 00:11:27,849
Yes, please.

173
00:11:27,849 --> 00:11:31,849
Sebastian! Sebastian, I'm hungry!

174
00:11:35,849 --> 00:11:37,849
Come on!

175
00:11:45,849 --> 00:11:47,849
Heidi!

176
00:11:47,849 --> 00:11:52,849
Good morning! Did the postman give you a letter for me today, Peter?

177
00:11:52,849 --> 00:11:55,849
No, why should he?

178
00:11:55,929 --> 00:11:58,929
Then Clara can't read my handwriting after all.

179
00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:00,929
Of course, Clara.

180
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,929
You can't write to me, can you?

181
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:04,929
You don't believe how happy you can be.

182
00:12:04,929 --> 00:12:07,929
You couldn't read my handwriting after all.

183
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,510
Are you sick?

184
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,510
Tell me, what's wrong with you?

185
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,510
You're slowly getting on my nerves.

186
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,510
I can't change that either.

187
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,510
What is it now? Are you coming?

188
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:32,510
No, I'm not going with you anymore. I'm going home. I have to write a letter.

189
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,510
You're crazy.

190
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,510
Fine, then I'm crazy.

191
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,510
That's not so mean!

192
00:12:42,926 --> 00:12:45,926
What do you want here?

193
00:12:45,926 --> 00:12:48,926
No, little ghost, you belong to your herd.

194
00:12:48,926 --> 00:12:51,926
Now eat well so you can grow, okay?

195
00:12:51,926 --> 00:12:52,926
Go on!

196
00:12:52,926 --> 00:12:55,926
No, no, no, I don't have time to play with you today.

197
00:12:55,926 --> 00:12:59,926
Run to the other little ghosts, and fast!

198
00:13:01,926 --> 00:13:03,926
I said fast!

199
00:13:10,766 --> 00:13:13,766
For Clara, she throws us away like an old roller.

200
00:13:13,766 --> 00:13:40,766
Love...

201
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:44,910
Finally you're fine. I'm fine too.

202
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,910
This time you can read my handwriting for sure.

203
00:14:04,686 --> 00:14:06,686
I'm home again, Clara!

204
00:14:06,686 --> 00:14:08,686
Papa, finally, papa!

205
00:14:10,686 --> 00:14:12,686
Nice, you look very good, my child.

206
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:14,686
I thought you were very pale.

207
00:14:14,686 --> 00:14:16,686
Mrs. Rottenmeier wrote you were on a hunger strike.

208
00:14:16,686 --> 00:14:17,686
What's going on?

209
00:14:17,686 --> 00:14:20,686
I wanted to, too. I was afraid you'd forget the promise you gave me.

210
00:14:20,686 --> 00:14:23,686
And you almost did, didn't you?

211
00:14:23,686 --> 00:14:25,686
How did you know?

212
00:14:25,686 --> 00:14:28,686
Clara, I just wanted to talk to you.

213
00:14:28,686 --> 00:14:31,686
You don't need to. I want to visit Heidi.

214
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,216
Who says you're not supposed to do that, child?

215
00:14:35,216 --> 00:14:38,416
Yes, but why do we have to talk then?

216
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:42,616
Because I want you to realize that I have to talk to the doctor first.

217
00:14:42,616 --> 00:14:45,016
I want to leave the decision to him.

218
00:14:45,016 --> 00:14:49,616
He knows best what is wrong for you and what is right for you.

219
00:14:49,616 --> 00:14:53,516
And I stupid man thought you kept your promise.

220
00:14:53,516 --> 00:14:57,016
But Clara, what am I supposed to do?

221
00:14:57,016 --> 00:15:00,016
Just keep your promise. I don't want any more.

222
00:15:00,222 --> 00:15:03,822
You are very strict and very unfair to me, Clara, do you know that?

223
00:15:04,022 --> 00:15:06,622
I know my promise and I want to keep it.

224
00:15:07,622 --> 00:15:10,022
I want to see Heidi, Dad, please.

225
00:15:13,222 --> 00:15:14,022
What is it?

226
00:15:14,222 --> 00:15:16,222
The Herr Geheimrat wants to speak to you.

227
00:15:16,422 --> 00:15:18,422
Don't worry, child, I'll be done with him.

228
00:15:18,622 --> 00:15:19,622
Hopefully.

229
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:32,099

230
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:35,099
Have you already made vacation plans for this summer?

231
00:15:35,099 --> 00:15:37,099
You always travel around this time.

232
00:15:37,099 --> 00:15:40,099
Yes, as usual. But this year I don't know where to go.

233
00:15:40,099 --> 00:15:43,099
Maybe to the North Sea or the Baltic Sea.

234
00:15:44,099 --> 00:15:48,099
I am undecided if I only knew how the weather will be.

235
00:15:48,099 --> 00:15:53,099
Well, I heard up there on the coast there should be a number of very nice
islands.

236
00:15:53,099 --> 00:15:56,099
Yes, that's why I thought about it.

237
00:15:56,553 --> 00:15:59,553
But you're right, it can be very rough up there.

238
00:15:59,553 --> 00:16:02,553
What do you think of Baden-Baden? My mother was there last year.

239
00:16:02,553 --> 00:16:04,553
She says it would be very pleasant.

240
00:16:04,553 --> 00:16:08,553
Yes, in a healing town, to Wiesbaden, for example, that's an idea.

241
00:16:08,553 --> 00:16:11,553
Peace, peace, hot springs.

242
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:14,553
I think I have reason to thank you, Mr. Sesemann.

243
00:16:14,553 --> 00:16:17,553
Wiesbaden is a pretty town and I don't have to drive far yet.

244
00:16:17,553 --> 00:16:19,553
I knew something else for you.

245
00:16:19,553 --> 00:16:21,553
Yes, you make me curious.

246
00:16:21,553 --> 00:16:22,553
Where are you sending me?

247
00:16:22,553 --> 00:16:23,553
To the Alps.

248
00:16:23,881 --> 00:16:27,681
What? I've been to the Alps every summer for ten years.

249
00:16:27,681 --> 00:16:29,281
It's beautiful there.

250
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:35,081
Splendid clear air, flowers, cows, goats, but I actually wanted to see something
different.

251
00:16:35,081 --> 00:16:40,481
Hm, if it's so beautiful in the mountains, wouldn't that be something for our
Clara?

252
00:16:40,481 --> 00:16:41,681
For your daughter?

253
00:16:41,681 --> 00:16:46,681
Well, air change wouldn't be bad for her, but whether that's the right thing to
do...

254
00:16:47,129 --> 00:16:52,129
I'm convinced that the fresh air, the peace, the peace, the good milk would be
good for her.

255
00:16:52,129 --> 00:16:54,129
But she can't use her wheelchair.

256
00:16:54,129 --> 00:16:58,129
The roads are steep and narrow and not paved.

257
00:16:58,129 --> 00:17:01,129
Maybe you could solve that problem.

258
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:03,129
But I'm afraid of the steep slopes.

259
00:17:03,129 --> 00:17:06,129
So that means no.

260
00:17:06,129 --> 00:17:10,129
I don't think your question came without a reason.

261
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:13,129
Yes, unfortunately. You know...

262
00:17:13,129 --> 00:17:16,129
Oh, let's leave it at that.

263
00:17:17,129 --> 00:17:19,129
Okay.

264
00:17:19,363 --> 00:17:22,363
Yes, that's it, that's it.

265
00:17:22,363 --> 00:17:23,363
What?

266
00:17:23,363 --> 00:17:26,363
Didn't you say you were going to the mountains earlier?

267
00:17:26,363 --> 00:17:27,363
Me?

268
00:17:27,363 --> 00:17:28,363
Yes, me.

269
00:17:28,363 --> 00:17:29,363
It doesn't matter.

270
00:17:29,363 --> 00:17:31,363
The main thing is that you're leaving tomorrow.

271
00:17:31,363 --> 00:17:32,363
Tomorrow?

272
00:17:32,363 --> 00:17:34,363
Yes, someone has to check how Heidi is doing.

273
00:17:34,363 --> 00:17:35,363
You want to go on vacation.

274
00:17:35,363 --> 00:17:36,363
You said that yourself.

275
00:17:36,363 --> 00:17:39,363
So what does that mean that you're going to the mountains?

276
00:17:39,363 --> 00:17:41,363
And that's best tomorrow.

277
00:17:41,363 --> 00:17:43,363
I haven't decided yet.

278
00:17:43,849 --> 00:17:45,849
But, Mr. Secret, I don't understand you.

279
00:17:45,849 --> 00:17:48,849
Earlier, you were like a schoolboy from the mountains, and now you're in a
hurry.

280
00:17:48,849 --> 00:17:49,849
Yes, but...

281
00:17:49,849 --> 00:17:50,849
No buts.

282
00:17:50,849 --> 00:17:52,849
I promised Clara that she could visit Heidi.

283
00:17:52,849 --> 00:17:54,849
And you have to keep promises.

284
00:17:56,849 --> 00:17:57,849
But no!

285
00:17:58,849 --> 00:18:00,849
Mr. Zesemann!

286
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:02,849
Clara?

287
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:04,849
Papa! Oh, good afternoon.

288
00:18:04,849 --> 00:18:05,849
Good afternoon.

289
00:18:05,849 --> 00:18:07,849
I have a message for you that will make you happy.

290
00:18:07,849 --> 00:18:09,849
We have come up with a solution.

291
00:18:09,849 --> 00:18:10,849
He drives up and watches everything.

292
00:18:10,849 --> 00:18:11,849
But no!

293
00:18:12,366 --> 00:18:16,166
The secret council? No, I have not yet decided on that.

294
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:22,166
Oh yes, don't worry, he's driving. He will visit Heidi and her grandfather and
see if you can go.

295
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,666
Well, what do you say to that? Nothing yet.

296
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:31,166
Clara Sesemann, now you disappoint me again. I expected you to be happy and what
do you do? A sad face.

297
00:18:31,766 --> 00:18:36,766
Yes. And if he doesn't like it up there, what then?

298
00:18:38,566 --> 00:18:41,966
You see? Then I'm not allowed to drive, that's what you mean.

299
00:18:42,302 --> 00:18:44,302
But I want to see Heidi.

300
00:18:44,302 --> 00:18:46,302
We've already noticed something.

301
00:18:50,302 --> 00:18:52,302
Clara, please believe me.

302
00:18:52,302 --> 00:18:56,302
I can understand that you're disappointed now, but have patience.

303
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,302
Always patience.

304
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:01,302
At the moment it's just about finding a proper accommodation for you.

305
00:19:02,302 --> 00:19:05,302
I can't send you to the mountains from today to tomorrow.

306
00:19:05,302 --> 00:19:07,302
We have to meet for preparations.

307
00:19:07,302 --> 00:19:10,302
That's just another excuse.

308
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,430
Excuse me, Mr. Secret Service.

309
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,430
Please find a way, okay?

310
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:16,430
Take a good look at it.

311
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,430
You have to tell me what it looks like.

312
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:21,430
I want to know if it really is what Heidi has always described it as.

313
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:24,430
But before you go, please come here again.

314
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,430
I would like to give you presents.

315
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:29,430
I know exactly what you all want from Heidi.

316
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:32,430
Grandfather likes tobacco for the pipe.

317
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,430
All right, pack everything.

318
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,430
I will greet you and give it to you.

319
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,430
Yes, please.

320
00:19:38,702 --> 00:19:41,702
Heidi will be sad that I can't come with you.

321
00:19:41,702 --> 00:19:44,702
Please tell her that I haven't forgotten her.

322
00:19:44,702 --> 00:19:47,702
Explain to her that it's not my fault. I'd like to come.

323
00:19:47,702 --> 00:19:51,702
I'll do that. She'll certainly understand.

324
00:19:51,702 --> 00:19:55,702
She's my girlfriend.

325
00:19:55,702 --> 00:19:58,702
Don't cry.

326
00:19:58,702 --> 00:20:02,702
I'm already curious what you're going to tell her.

327
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:05,702
I like you better this way, Clara.

328
00:20:05,702 --> 00:20:08,702
You're laughing again.

329
00:20:08,846 --> 00:20:11,846
Herr Geheimrat, packen Sie.

330
00:20:11,846 --> 00:20:13,846
Ja, gut.

331
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:17,846
Ich werde Fräulein Rottenmeier zu dir schicken, damit ihr gleich die Geschenke
besprechen könnt.

332
00:20:17,846 --> 00:20:21,846
Ja, und sie soll den größten Koffer vom Dachboden holen.

333
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:41,846
Guten Morgen, hat dir der Postbote heute einen Brief mitgegeben?

334
00:20:41,846 --> 00:20:43,846
Ja!

335
00:20:43,846 --> 00:20:45,752
Endlich, sie hat geschrieben.

336
00:20:45,752 --> 00:20:48,752
Clara wrote me a letter, hopefully a long one.

337
00:20:48,752 --> 00:20:49,752
Morning.

338
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:53,752
If you say it again, I'm talking nonsense.

339
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,752
I won't say it today, but don't you want your letter?

340
00:20:55,752 --> 00:20:57,752
Is it a long one?

341
00:20:57,752 --> 00:20:58,752
I don't know.

342
00:20:58,752 --> 00:21:00,752
Show it to me, we'll open it.

343
00:21:01,752 --> 00:21:04,752
Oh Peter, I've been waiting for it for so long.

344
00:21:04,752 --> 00:21:05,752
You can probably say that.

345
00:21:05,752 --> 00:21:07,752
Yes, I know.

346
00:21:08,323 --> 00:21:12,323
My dear friend Heidi, thank you very much for the many letters.

347
00:21:12,323 --> 00:21:15,323
How are you? I'm fine. There's something new.

348
00:21:15,323 --> 00:21:18,323
The Herr Geheimrat is coming to you in the mountains.

349
00:21:18,323 --> 00:21:21,323
Clara is coming with the Geheimrat! Grandfather!

350
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:25,323
Clara is writing that she is coming to visit us with the Geheimrat.

351
00:21:25,379 --> 00:21:31,619
I've already packed all the presents. A warm winter coat for you and a scarf for
Peter's grandmother.

352
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:33,619
And tobacco for your grandfather.

353
00:21:33,619 --> 00:21:37,879
And because you told me that Peter likes to eat, I've also packed sausages.

354
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:38,879
That's good.

355
00:21:38,879 --> 00:21:39,879
Oh.

356
00:21:39,879 --> 00:21:42,879
They taste good. They're different from the ones we always eat here.

357
00:21:42,879 --> 00:21:44,379
Yes, do you mean that?

358
00:21:44,379 --> 00:21:46,879
Many, maybe even...

359
00:21:46,879 --> 00:21:48,879
A whole suitcase full!

360
00:21:48,879 --> 00:21:50,379
A suitcase!

361
00:21:50,379 --> 00:21:54,379
But doesn't she give him everything at once, or does he eat them all at once?

362
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:55,859
That's what it says.

363
00:21:55,859 --> 00:21:57,259
Of course it says that.

364
00:21:57,259 --> 00:22:00,059
Do you think I came up with that?

365
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:03,259
Don't give him everything at once, or he'll eat them all at once.

366
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:04,259
That's what it says.

367
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:07,659
You can check it if you want, but you can't read it.

368
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,459
Of course I can, but not so fast.

369
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:13,859
I'm so happy to see you again one day, Heidi.

370
00:22:14,259 --> 00:22:18,259
And I finally want to get to know Peter and his grandfather.

371
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:23,459
Heidi, are you finally satisfied?

372
00:22:24,467 --> 00:22:28,467
You don't know how much.

373
00:22:28,467 --> 00:22:33,467
Klara, Klara, come, Klara has written, she's coming.

374
00:22:33,467 --> 00:22:36,467
Heidi had misunderstood Klara's letter.

375
00:22:36,467 --> 00:22:42,467
Maybe it was because she couldn't even imagine in her dream that Klara would not
come.

376
00:22:42,467 --> 00:22:47,467
That Klara only spoke in her letter from the secret council, to which she wanted
to give gifts.

377
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:50,035
She had overread that.

378
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:57,035
Every morning, when Heidi opened her eyes, she hoped that Peter had a new letter
with him, in which Klara would announce her arrival.

379
00:22:57,035 --> 00:23:04,035
But instead of a letter, the secret council came. Peter met him one day when he
went up to the meadow with the goats.

380
00:23:04,035 --> 00:23:10,035
And after he had understood who the stranger was, he brought him to Heidi and
the Almöhi.

381
00:23:10,035 --> 00:23:15,035
Heidi was disappointed. She was angry and distressed that Klara did not come
with her.

382
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:22,299
With the help of a milk bucket, the secret guard tried to make it clear to her
how dangerous the stay in the mountains would be for a girl in a wheelchair.

383
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:25,299
But Heidi was not convinced so quickly.

384
00:23:25,299 --> 00:23:28,799
But we want to tell you about this in our next story.

385
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:36,799
Heidi, Heidi, your world are the mountains.

386
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:44,799
Heidi, Heidi, because up here you are at home.

387
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:50,799
Heidi, Heidi, come home.

388
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:57,799
Find your happiness, come back home.
