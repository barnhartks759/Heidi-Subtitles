00:00:04,686 --> 00:00:09,686
Holadio

2
00:00:12,686 --> 00:00:17,686
Holadio

3
00:00:20,686 --> 00:00:24,686
Heidi

4
00:00:24,686 --> 00:00:28,686
Your world are the mountains

5
00:00:28,686 --> 00:00:32,686
Heidi

6
00:00:32,686 --> 00:00:36,686
Because up here you are at home

7
00:00:36,686 --> 00:00:40,686
Dark firs

8
00:00:40,686 --> 00:00:44,686
Green meadows in the sunshine

9
00:00:44,686 --> 00:00:48,686
Heidi, Heidi

10
00:00:48,686 --> 00:00:52,686
You need to be happy

11
00:00:52,686 --> 00:01:01,686
Holadio

12
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:02,686
Holadio

13
00:01:02,686 --> 00:01:05,686
Holadio

14
00:01:05,686 --> 00:01:09,686
Heidi, Heidi

15
00:01:09,686 --> 00:01:11,686
Come home

16
00:01:11,686 --> 00:01:13,686
Find your happiness

17
00:01:13,686 --> 00:01:18,686
Come back home

18
00:01:19,642 --> 00:01:28,642
It was a wonderful spring day, the sun was shining, it was warm and Heidi could
stay outside all day long and pick flowers for the first time.

19
00:01:28,642 --> 00:01:36,642
Heidi had all the reasons to be happy and content, but something was going on
today that was strange, that bothered her.

20
00:01:36,642 --> 00:01:41,642
First the priest was there and then suddenly Aunt Dete came. What did Aunt Dete
want?

21
00:01:41,642 --> 00:01:47,642
She hadn't been up here on the alp for three years and Heidi had almost
forgotten her.

22
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,840
And why did her grandfather send her out to play?

23
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,840
It wasn't very easy for you, I know.

24
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,840
But what was I supposed to do?

25
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,840
I had no other choice. You were the only one I could trust.

26
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,840
You can handle children.

27
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,840
You also know how it was, Almöhe.

28
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,840
I didn't find a job in Dörfli at the time.

29
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,840
The only job I was given was in Frankfurt.

30
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,840
And where was I supposed to go with her? I was also a stranger.

31
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,840
I didn't know where I was supposed to go.

32
00:02:25,242 --> 00:02:27,242
You're not making it easy for me.

33
00:02:27,242 --> 00:02:30,242
You can be happy, I'll take her with me now.

34
00:02:30,242 --> 00:02:35,242
It took a long time, but now I'm finally so far that I know how I can take care
of her.

35
00:02:35,242 --> 00:02:38,242
You want to take her with you?

36
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:40,242
Yes, I'll take her with me.

37
00:02:43,242 --> 00:02:46,242
I really have a very good message for you.

38
00:02:46,242 --> 00:02:49,242
Heidi has a possibility that only one in a thousand children has.

39
00:02:49,242 --> 00:02:52,242
Oh, what am I talking about, one in a hundred thousand children.

40
00:02:53,744 --> 00:02:57,244
In Frankfurt there is a family, the Sesemann family.

41
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:59,244
Mr. Sesemann is the richest man in town.

42
00:02:59,244 --> 00:03:02,744
And Mr. Sesemann has a daughter, and the daughter's name is Clara.

43
00:03:02,744 --> 00:03:06,244
Mr. Sesemann loves his daughter, but this daughter is crippled.

44
00:03:06,244 --> 00:03:09,244
And now they are looking for a little, nice, lovely girl

45
00:03:09,244 --> 00:03:13,244
who will spend time with Clara and give private school lessons.

46
00:03:14,744 --> 00:03:17,744
Heidi is taken in the house like a second daughter.

47
00:03:17,744 --> 00:03:20,744
I know it. I work for Sesemann's relatives.

48
00:03:22,898 --> 00:03:30,898
When I heard about it for the first time, I didn't want to believe it, but the
housekeeper, Mrs. Rottenmeier, confirmed it to me personally.

49
00:03:30,898 --> 00:03:34,898
You don't believe how beautiful the house is that Heidi is supposed to come
into.

50
00:03:36,898 --> 00:03:40,898
It's a big old Frankfurt house with many windows and a heavy front door.

51
00:03:40,898 --> 00:03:46,898
And in this house Clara sits in the wheelchair all day long and can't go outside
because she can't walk.

52
00:03:46,898 --> 00:03:50,898
Mr. Sesemann does everything for his daughter, but he is very often traveling.

53
00:03:51,032 --> 00:03:54,032
And your mother doesn't have Clara anymore.

54
00:03:54,032 --> 00:03:56,032
The poor thing.

55
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,032
Mr. Sesemann takes every wish from her eyes.

56
00:03:59,032 --> 00:04:02,032
He even brought a private teacher into the house for her.

57
00:04:02,032 --> 00:04:05,032
He brings Clara everything she needs to know.

58
00:04:05,032 --> 00:04:09,032
She has more toys than all the children in our village.

59
00:04:09,032 --> 00:04:12,824
But she is sad all day. She never laughs.

60
00:04:12,824 --> 00:04:19,824
And that's why Mr. Sesemann and Mrs. Rottenmeier asked me if I didn't know a
playmate for Clara.

61
00:04:19,824 --> 00:04:22,324
Of course I immediately thought of Heidi.

62
00:04:22,324 --> 00:04:24,824
I told everything about Heidi that I knew.

63
00:04:24,824 --> 00:04:29,824
I described exactly how happy she is and how clever she is and how quickly she
understands.

64
00:04:29,824 --> 00:04:31,824
But believe me, that wasn't that easy.

65
00:04:31,824 --> 00:04:35,824
Mrs. Rottenmeier is hard to please. She is very, very strict.

66
00:04:35,824 --> 00:04:37,824
But she is good with Clara. You have to let her be.

67
00:04:37,824 --> 00:04:41,824
Well, and you know the rest. I came here.

68
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,824
You have to let her be.

69
00:04:50,866 --> 00:04:53,366
Yes, that's exactly what I knew.

70
00:04:53,366 --> 00:04:56,566
You were surprised by my good news.

71
00:04:56,566 --> 00:04:59,166
I'm so proud and so happy.

72
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,966
And what else do you have to say to me?

73
00:05:00,966 --> 00:05:02,766
You think I just figured it out.

74
00:05:02,766 --> 00:05:04,366
Oh, you're wrong.

75
00:05:04,366 --> 00:05:09,166
I wonder all the time that you don't talk to me and don't show a little bit of
joy.

76
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,366
Well, you've always been wordy.

77
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:12,666
Nevertheless, it's strange.

78
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:16,066
Everyone else would jump into the air for joy with such a message.

79
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,266
Nice.

80
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,560
Now tell this message to those who want to jump into the air.

81
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,560
Now listen to me. Heidi is now eight years old. She can't do anything and she
doesn't know anything.

82
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,560
She can neither read, nor write, nor can the child calculate.

83
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,560
And down in the village they told me you won't even allow her to go to school.

84
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,560
That's all my business. What's good for Heidi, I know better than you all
together.

85
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,560
Do you understand me? She stays here.

86
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,288
Heidi is the child of my deceased sister and I am responsible for her happiness.

87
00:05:45,288 --> 00:05:49,788
If you want to go to court with me, then do it, but what do you think who will
win, huh?

88
00:05:49,788 --> 00:05:52,788
Every single resident in Dörfli will speak for me.

89
00:05:52,788 --> 00:05:55,788
And you can believe me, they're already looking forward to it.

90
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:59,788
She has to go to school. How are they ever going to get along in life if you're
not there anymore?

91
00:05:59,788 --> 00:06:05,788
I just don't understand you. I only want the best for Heidi and you act as if I
were doing something bad here.

92
00:06:05,788 --> 00:06:10,788
But please, as you wish, let her come to court for a dispute.

93
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:14,788
Are you finally finished or do you still want something new?

94
00:06:14,788 --> 00:06:15,376
I'm going!

95
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:17,376
You don't believe how much I still remember.

96
00:06:18,176 --> 00:06:23,176
As long as I'm here and talk to you, you will unfortunately have to listen to me
whether you want it or not.

97
00:06:24,876 --> 00:06:28,176
The last time you chased me away from here like a rowdy dog.

98
00:06:28,376 --> 00:06:32,676
But now, thank God, I no longer have to be treated like that by you.

99
00:06:32,676 --> 00:06:34,676
I have become a lady in the meantime.

100
00:06:35,076 --> 00:06:38,376
And you will probably know how to treat women.

101
00:06:39,776 --> 00:06:41,576
Do you still not want to talk?

102
00:06:43,376 --> 00:06:45,176
Well, if that's the case...

103
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,280
If you don't want to answer me, then other people have to come here and they'll
know how to force you.

104
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,580
I'm sorry, but you didn't want it any other way.

105
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,780
Now that's enough for me. Stop it!

106
00:07:02,954 --> 00:07:07,454
Well, take them with you, but never bring them back here again in your life.

107
00:07:07,454 --> 00:07:11,454
Then I'll teach you what you have to know about life if you're so smart.

108
00:07:11,454 --> 00:07:14,454
But if you talk about the stupid things you say about yourself,

109
00:07:14,454 --> 00:07:16,454
and you understand the albino feather on your hat,

110
00:07:16,454 --> 00:07:18,454
then I'd rather not know anything about it.

111
00:07:18,454 --> 00:07:19,954
Do you understand me?

112
00:07:19,954 --> 00:07:20,954
Yes.

113
00:07:23,954 --> 00:07:25,954
Let Heidi decide for herself.

114
00:07:25,954 --> 00:07:28,454
She's old enough. She knows what she wants.

115
00:07:28,454 --> 00:07:30,704
I know her. She won't want to go.

116
00:07:30,704 --> 00:07:34,904
I wouldn't be so sure at your place, who knows who you've dealt with.

117
00:07:36,104 --> 00:07:38,104
Oh, God, how stupid you are.

118
00:07:38,504 --> 00:07:41,304
We'll see who's the stupid one of us.

119
00:08:00,704 --> 00:08:03,704
- Are you ready? - Can you tell me what you've talked about?

120
00:08:04,704 --> 00:08:05,704
Yes.

121
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:17,770
- And? - I asked your Oehi if you could travel with me, and he allowed it.

122
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,770
- How? - We're going to Frankfurt together.

123
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,170
- But I don't want to go away. - But you do.

124
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,970
Frankfurt is a big city, you'll like it, there's a lot to see.

125
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,770
- But I don't want to see it! - Yes, you do.

126
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,770
I know you mean it, but I don't want to go with you.

127
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,970
Heidi, you don't even know if you want to go with me.

128
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:38,770
Put on your hat and come.

129
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,800
Look, I came all the way here to get you, and now you disappoint me like this.

130
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,800
But it's beautiful here. I like it here.

131
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,800
In Frankfurt you like it much better.

132
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,800
There you will be able to read every wish from your eyes.

133
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,800
And you certainly have many wishes.

134
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,800
Every little girl wishes something that she would like very much.

135
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,696
No.

136
00:09:06,696 --> 00:09:09,696
No, I don't wish anything at all. I want to stay here.

137
00:09:09,696 --> 00:09:11,696
Heidi, you don't know what you're saying.

138
00:09:11,696 --> 00:09:13,696
I can't come with you. I have to take care of Schnucki.

139
00:09:13,696 --> 00:09:16,696
And besides, we have spring now. I can't go away.

140
00:09:16,696 --> 00:09:19,696
Come again in the winter. Grandfather and I will go together.

141
00:09:19,696 --> 00:09:23,696
It shouldn't be forever, Heidi. Come with me and I'll take a look at you.

142
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:26,696
If you don't like it, you can go home right away.

143
00:09:26,696 --> 00:09:28,440
I don't like it!

144
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,640
Besides, I can't drive because I promised to visit Peter's grandmother.

145
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,840
She gets sad when I don't come. I go to her almost every day.

146
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,640
But you can also visit her from Frankfurt.

147
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,240
And then you bring her many presents.

148
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,040
- What? - What you want.

149
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,240
Is there soft white bread in Frankfurt?

150
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,540
She sometimes said she can't bite the black bread with her teeth anymore.

151
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,640
But she has no money to buy herself white bread.

152
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,640
You can buy yourself a whole suitcase full of white bread.

153
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:05,880
Heidi remembered very well the afternoon when the grandmother had to put the
bread aside again because it was already so old and hard.

154
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,880
Her grandmother was so sorry at the time, but she also didn't know how to help
her.

155
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,880
She would have liked to have given her own bread, but that was also hard.

156
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:21,880
The thought of driving the grandmother to the city of Frankfurt to buy soft
rolls began to appeal to her.

157
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,880
Yes, tell me, can I be back tonight?

158
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,880
Today?

159
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,480
But I promised you, you can go home right away if you want.

160
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,480
Do you think I can bring something to my grandfather?

161
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,480
Yes, why not?

162
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,480
We will definitely find something for him too.

163
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,480
Tobacco!

164
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,480
Come on, we have to hurry.

165
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,480
So be nice and put on your coat, okay?

166
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,480
Yes, and a goat pipe for Peter.

167
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,480
Of course.

168
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,480
Come on, hurry up, Aunt Dede.

169
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,480
I always have to be at home before it gets dark.

170
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,480
Come on, quick!

171
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,480
What is it?

172
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,480
Grandfather, I'm going with you to Frankfurt to buy some...

173
00:11:01,698 --> 00:11:03,698
The best bread!

174
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:07,698
Goodbye! See you later!

175
00:11:11,106 --> 00:11:18,106
Don't go away Heidi. Child, she promised you everything.

176
00:11:19,598 --> 00:11:21,598
Come on, let's go.

177
00:12:04,646 --> 00:12:27,646
Heidi, do you want to go to my grandmother's?

178
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:29,646
No, I'm going to Frankfurt.

179
00:12:29,646 --> 00:12:31,646
That's a good joke.

180
00:12:31,646 --> 00:12:33,646
That's not a joke at all. Aunt Dede will take me.

181
00:12:33,646 --> 00:12:36,646
But Frankfurt is so far away.

182
00:12:36,646 --> 00:12:38,646
It's not that far. I'm back tonight.

183
00:12:38,646 --> 00:12:39,646
That's Peter.

184
00:12:39,646 --> 00:12:39,994
Heidi, no!

185
00:12:39,994 --> 00:12:42,994
Stay here! It's already late. We don't have time to talk to him.

186
00:12:42,994 --> 00:12:45,994
But Peter is my best friend and I also want to go to his grandmother.

187
00:12:45,994 --> 00:12:48,994
You can talk to them for many hours when you come back.

188
00:12:48,994 --> 00:12:49,994
Let's go now!

189
00:12:49,994 --> 00:12:52,994
No! Let me go! I want to tell Peter about the white rolls!

190
00:12:52,994 --> 00:12:55,994
Stay! Please don't leave me alone!

191
00:12:56,218 --> 00:12:58,218
Please don't pull yourself too hard!

192
00:12:58,218 --> 00:12:59,218
Let me go!

193
00:13:01,218 --> 00:13:03,218
Aunt Dede, please don't!

194
00:13:11,218 --> 00:13:13,218
Help!

195
00:13:19,218 --> 00:13:20,218
Gross!

196
00:13:21,498 --> 00:13:23,498
Peter, you're scaring me to death.

197
00:13:23,498 --> 00:13:25,498
Do you have to be so loud?

198
00:13:25,498 --> 00:13:30,498
Peter, do you put the wood outside or should it stay on the table?

199
00:13:30,498 --> 00:13:34,498
He seems to have to sit for a week, at least he makes such a face.

200
00:13:35,498 --> 00:13:37,498
He should have deserved that.

201
00:13:43,514 --> 00:13:47,514
Peter, what's wrong with you? Did you have a fight with the children?

202
00:13:48,514 --> 00:13:50,514
No, I didn't!

203
00:13:50,514 --> 00:13:53,514
But now I'm starting to worry about you.

204
00:13:55,514 --> 00:13:59,514
Oh, what? It's about Heidi! She's so mean!

205
00:13:59,514 --> 00:14:01,514
Dete took her with us to Frankfurt!

206
00:14:01,514 --> 00:14:02,514
No!

207
00:14:02,514 --> 00:14:04,410
Yes, I saw it!

208
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,410
Oh, she can't do that.

209
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,410
But maybe Heidi can't do anything about it.

210
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,410
Yes, she went with us and that's bad enough.

211
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,410
Dede, leave the child here.

212
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,410
Dede, leave her here.

213
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,410
Dede, Dede, bring Heidi back.

214
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:20,410
She is everything we have.

215
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,410
Dede, Dede, Dede.

216
00:14:27,354 --> 00:14:30,354
- Peter's grandmother is calling for me. - Come on, we don't have time.

217
00:14:30,354 --> 00:14:34,354
But she called me. I have to go to her. Did you forget that she's blind?

218
00:14:34,354 --> 00:14:37,354
Oh, let me finally be in peace with this old grandmother.

219
00:14:37,354 --> 00:14:40,354
- Yes, she's old, but very sweet. - One thing I want to tell you now.

220
00:14:40,354 --> 00:14:43,354
If we want to get along in friendship, never yell at me again.

221
00:14:43,354 --> 00:14:47,354
- I'm not yelling, but let me go. - I don't think about it.

222

223
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:04,210
Grandmother, please come back in. You are not to be seen anymore.

224
00:15:12,082 --> 00:15:16,082
Come, I'll take you to your chair, yes? That's good.

225
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:21,082
She will come back. Don't worry, she'll come back for sure.

226
00:15:21,082 --> 00:15:24,082
Calm down. Everything will be fine again.

227
00:15:26,082 --> 00:15:30,082
Brigitte, I don't think you told her the truth.

228
00:15:30,082 --> 00:15:35,082
I feel it, I just don't know why. Why did he let her go?

229
00:15:42,082 --> 00:15:46,082
THE FOURTH DAY

230
00:15:49,082 --> 00:16:02,082
And one and two and three and four and five and six and seven and eight and nine
and ten.

231
00:16:02,082 --> 00:16:04,082
There's Heidi.

232
00:16:04,818 --> 00:16:06,818
But that's funny.

233
00:16:06,818 --> 00:16:08,818
Everything is funny with him.

234
00:16:08,818 --> 00:16:10,818
Mom, come to the window.

235
00:16:10,818 --> 00:16:12,818
There comes the date with Heidi.

236
00:16:12,818 --> 00:16:14,818
No, not possible.

237
00:16:20,786 --> 00:16:24,786
Well, Dete, you seem to have been really lucky.

238
00:16:24,786 --> 00:16:25,786
Yes.

239
00:16:25,786 --> 00:16:28,786
Oh, did he just give it to you like that?

240
00:16:28,786 --> 00:16:29,786
Well, something like that.

241
00:16:29,786 --> 00:16:30,786
She came along on her own.

242
00:16:30,786 --> 00:16:31,786
No!

243
00:16:31,786 --> 00:16:34,786
I only go with her because I want white rolls.

244
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:37,786
You can also get them and much more.

245
00:16:37,786 --> 00:16:40,786
It's time that she is finally raised properly.

246
00:16:40,786 --> 00:16:41,786
Goodbye.

247
00:16:48,786 --> 00:16:49,394
No, no.

248
00:16:49,394 --> 00:16:51,394
No, no! How do you find that?

249
00:16:51,394 --> 00:16:55,394
Well, I can't imagine that she voluntarily gave it to her.

250
00:16:56,158 --> 00:16:59,158

252
00:17:31,794 --> 00:17:38,794
Oh dear God, hopefully Heidi will come back. I want to have the child again.
She's always so happy.

253
00:17:38,794 --> 00:17:41,794
She'll come back. Calm down.

254
00:17:44,794 --> 00:17:50,794
She's gone. I love her so much. Every morning I was looking forward to her
coming.

255
00:18:01,794 --> 00:18:02,250
To be continued

256
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,250
So!

257
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,250
I'll tell him my opinion now!

258
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,958
Please!

259
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,958
Open the door!

260
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,958
Open the door!

261
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,958
Open the door!

262
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:39,958
I know you're there! Open the door!

263
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,958
I know you're there!

264
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,958
I know you're there!

265
00:19:12,746 --> 00:19:16,746
Why are you running away? Come back, Peter, please.

266
00:19:22,186 --> 00:19:24,186
I'm glad you're here.

267
00:19:25,186 --> 00:19:27,186
Have you eaten lunch?

268
00:19:28,186 --> 00:19:30,186
No, only half.

269
00:19:30,186 --> 00:19:32,186
Then come.

270
00:19:41,354 --> 00:19:43,354
Why is she gone?

271
00:19:47,402 --> 00:19:50,402
Why did you send Heidi away from here?

272
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:56,930
She... She didn't do anything bad.

273
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,230
She wanted to. I didn't send her.

274
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,430
She wanted to go on her own?

275
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:12,450
No, I don't want to believe that.

276
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,450
It's true.

277
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:19,450
And she will never come back.

278
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,450
But...

279
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:24,450
Heidi goes to a city.

280
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,450
And the city changes the people.

281
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:28,450
They are destroyed there.

282
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:33,450
Heidi won't go anywhere, not even to this city!

283
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:37,450
Heidi will stay our Heidi all her life, won't she?

284
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,450
Yes, she will.

285
00:20:52,746 --> 00:20:54,746
Peter!

286
00:20:55,318 --> 00:20:57,318
!

287
00:21:25,318 --> 00:21:28,318
That's a real mile!

288
00:21:33,318 --> 00:21:36,318
Heidi!

289
00:21:36,318 --> 00:21:39,318
Heidi!

290
00:21:55,318 --> 00:22:04,318
If we don't hurry, I'll never be back tonight!

291
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:07,866
I can't walk faster in a long skirt. I've stumbled three times already.

292
00:22:07,866 --> 00:22:11,866
Why do you have such a long skirt? In the village, women all wear short skirts.

293
00:22:15,866 --> 00:22:18,866
Heidi ran down the mountain as fast as she could.

294
00:22:18,866 --> 00:22:26,866
She was determined to buy white rolls for her grandmother and still be back for
dinner.

295
00:22:26,866 --> 00:22:30,866
She knew that her grandfather wouldn't like it if she came home too late.

296
00:22:30,866 --> 00:22:34,504
That's why she got a bit angry with Aunt Dete.

297
00:22:34,504 --> 00:22:36,504
Why did she go so slowly?

298
00:22:36,504 --> 00:22:42,504
Didn't she know that she, Heidi, had promised to come home before dark?

299
00:22:43,504 --> 00:22:49,504
Heidi didn't dream that she would see her grandfather neither this evening nor
the next evening.

300
00:22:49,504 --> 00:22:53,504
It took a very long time for her to realize how far the road to Frankfurt is.

301
00:22:54,504 --> 00:22:56,504
At first she felt the train ride.

302
00:22:56,504 --> 00:23:01,504
But then she had to think of her grandfather and she became infinitely sad.

303
00:23:01,504 --> 00:23:04,504
What would he do without her? Would he come to her?

304
00:23:04,904 --> 00:23:08,404
How would it go for him, alone up there in the mountains?

305
00:23:08,404 --> 00:23:12,404
When would she see him and the grandmother and all her friends again?

306
00:23:12,404 --> 00:23:14,904
Frankfurt, what should she do there?

307
00:23:14,904 --> 00:23:17,904
Heidi thought about it and she made up her mind.

308
00:23:17,904 --> 00:23:21,904
But we want to tell you about it in our next story.

309
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:30,318
Heide, Heide, your world are the mountains.

310
00:23:30,318 --> 00:23:38,318
Heide, Heide, because up here you are at home.

311
00:23:38,318 --> 00:23:44,318
Heide, Heide, come home.

312
00:23:44,318 --> 00:23:51,318
Find your happiness, come back again.

313
00:23:52,318 --> 00:23:53,792
