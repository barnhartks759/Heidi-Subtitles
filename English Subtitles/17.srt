00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,750
This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to real persons, living or dead, is
coincidental and unintentional.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:13,750
It is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to real persons, living or dead, is
coincidental and unintentional.

3
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:52,750
Up here you are at home. Dark firs, green meadows in the sunshine. Heidi, Heidi,
you need to be happy.

4
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:18,750
I'll hold you up high. Heidi, Heidi, come home. Find your happiness. Come back
again.

5
00:01:19,834 --> 00:01:28,834
Do you remember? Peter brought a letter and in the letter it said that Heidi
would be old enough to go to school.

6
00:01:28,834 --> 00:01:32,834
But the grandfather didn't want to know anything about it.

7
00:01:33,834 --> 00:01:38,656
During the long winter Heidi forgot the letter and the plan to go to school.

8
00:01:38,656 --> 00:01:46,056
And when the first snow melted and it was slowly spring, Heidi didn't even have
the fun of reading from the alp again.

9
00:01:46,056 --> 00:01:49,356
She couldn't keep anything in the hut any longer. Heidi wanted to go outside.

10
00:01:49,356 --> 00:01:53,356
She wanted to see and hear and smell spring.

11
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,510
* Music *

12
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,858
It already smells like spring.

13
00:02:24,858 --> 00:02:29,858
- Did you talk to the trees again? - Yes, but there was always no answer.

14
00:02:31,858 --> 00:02:35,858
Do you know that you can hear the spring? The wind sounds different and there
are a lot more birds.

15
00:02:35,858 --> 00:02:40,858
I know. You can hear the spring, you can feel the spring and you can smell the
spring.

16
00:02:40,858 --> 00:02:42,858
But you don't make a spring visit.

17
00:02:42,858 --> 00:02:46,858
Yes, with the grandmother. Joseph, we'll make a visit.

18
00:02:54,858 --> 00:02:55,546
To be continued

19
00:02:55,546 --> 00:02:57,546
The snow looks good, doesn't it?

20
00:02:57,546 --> 00:03:00,546
You know, you can make a nice, solid snowball out of it.

21
00:03:02,546 --> 00:03:05,546
Watch out! He's flying far!

22
00:03:07,546 --> 00:03:11,546
And he's flying even farther! And he's flying even farther!

23
00:03:11,546 --> 00:03:13,546
Hey!

24
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:24,081
I really didn't know that someone was coming.

25
00:03:24,081 --> 00:03:27,581
That's good, my child. I agree with the assumption that you are Heidi.

26
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:29,581
Who else could you be?

27
00:03:29,581 --> 00:03:31,581
You're right, I am Heidi.

28
00:03:31,581 --> 00:03:35,581
You see, my child, I could rely on my knowledge of people again.

29
00:03:35,581 --> 00:03:37,581
Is your grandfather at home?

30
00:03:37,581 --> 00:03:40,581
Grandfather! Grandfather!

31
00:03:40,581 --> 00:03:43,581
I have a surprise for you. We have a visitor.

32
00:03:43,581 --> 00:03:45,581
Oh?

33
00:03:45,581 --> 00:03:48,581
Greetings, God. Am I late?

34
00:03:50,573 --> 00:03:53,573
Good day. Why don't you come in?

35
00:03:53,573 --> 00:03:56,573
May I offer you this chair? We don't have a chair here.

36
00:03:56,573 --> 00:03:58,573
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

37
00:03:58,573 --> 00:04:00,573
The ascent is also getting steeper and steeper.

38
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:01,573
That's deceiving.

39
00:04:01,573 --> 00:04:05,573
Of course, it could also be because I'm getting older.

40
00:04:05,573 --> 00:04:08,573
That should just be a little bit of me.

41
00:04:08,573 --> 00:04:11,573
Let's leave that. Let's get down to business.

42
00:04:11,573 --> 00:04:14,573
You must already know why I'm here.

43
00:04:14,573 --> 00:04:16,573
I want to talk to you about Heidi.

44
00:04:16,573 --> 00:04:18,323
Heidi.

45
00:04:18,323 --> 00:04:21,823
Please leave us alone for a moment. I'm going out to play again.

46
00:04:21,823 --> 00:04:23,823
Uh-huh. I'll do that.

47
00:04:29,133 --> 00:04:37,133
We sent you a letter. And in the letter it said that you should send her to
school, but she was not there for a single day.

48
00:04:37,133 --> 00:04:42,133
I, as the shepherd of my sheep, ask you: How do you want to prepare her for her
way of life?

49
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:47,133
It is not enough to give a child food and clothing, one is also responsible for
his soul.

50
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:51,133
That's cute!

51
00:04:51,373 --> 00:04:54,373
Grandfather has a very important visit today.

52
00:04:56,373 --> 00:04:59,373
Heidi stays with me and I don't want to hear anything from the school.

53
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:09,373
You seem to be a little unruly, my son. You should go inside.

54
00:05:09,373 --> 00:05:11,373
I am very ruled.

55
00:05:13,373 --> 00:05:17,373
I gave Heidi a home and made her a happy person.

56
00:05:17,373 --> 00:05:20,373
She grows with me with the goats, the birds and nature.

57
00:05:20,963 --> 00:05:24,963
She is free and happy, and no school can teach her that.

58
00:05:24,963 --> 00:05:27,963
Sit down! Sit down!

59
00:05:27,963 --> 00:05:29,963
No! Lay down!

60
00:05:41,581 --> 00:05:47,901
Heidi is a human being and not one of your milk goats. She needs something more
to be happy than just grass.

61
00:05:47,901 --> 00:05:53,821
I know you. I know that I can't force you, but you should at least think again.

62
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:58,821
I don't want to judge whether you are doing well or bad. I didn't come to take
her away from you.

63
00:05:58,821 --> 00:06:04,381
I'm here to talk to you about it. Others know other means and ways to bring you
to reason.

64
00:06:04,381 --> 00:06:05,661
Then they should come.

65
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:07,661
Brother, brother.

66
00:06:10,368 --> 00:06:15,768
How have I earned that? Why in all the world are you only so infinitely
stubborn?

67
00:06:15,768 --> 00:06:19,848
Will you never accept reason in life? Why are you making it so difficult for me?

68
00:06:19,848 --> 00:06:23,548
I just want your best. You have come a long way in the world.

69
00:06:23,548 --> 00:06:28,008
You should have a little more insight. Dear Lord in heaven,

70
00:06:28,008 --> 00:06:31,488
stand by me so that I don't say anything that I regret afterwards.

71
00:06:31,488 --> 00:06:35,268
The descent is very steep and you are not the youngest.

72
00:06:36,086 --> 00:06:39,286
Heidi didn't know what the two were talking about in the hut.

73
00:06:39,286 --> 00:06:45,086
She was happy and unharmed as always and enjoyed the last snow that she could
find.

74
00:06:52,768 --> 00:06:57,768
If I let you climb down the mountain every day for four hours, even I'll get
tired of it.

75
00:06:57,768 --> 00:07:00,768
Hurry up, Joseph, or you won't catch me.

76
00:07:04,768 --> 00:07:08,768
The goal is too small and too weak. That's impossible. No!

77
00:07:08,768 --> 00:07:11,768
The two men argued with each other for many hours.

78
00:07:11,768 --> 00:07:15,768
None of them wanted to give in. None of them was optimistic.

79
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:19,768
Come on, these smart people, and take the child away from me.

80
00:07:19,768 --> 00:07:21,768
I'll know how to defend myself.

81
00:07:22,768 --> 00:07:23,840
I'll know how to defend myself.

82
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:30,840
Neighbor, neighbor, if you knew how brave I am, believe me, you will do a great
sin to this child.

83
00:07:35,904 --> 00:07:41,904
As I can see from the many games, you like to hate the child and do everything
for her.

84
00:07:41,904 --> 00:07:45,904
Why don't you just go with us to DÃ¶rfli? That would solve our problems.

85
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,280
We would have solved two problems.

86
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:05,280
Heidi would come to school and I would finally be able to greet you again in the
church.

87
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,280
I could have been on my way home a long time ago, but you don't have any mercy
with your poor fellow human beings.

88
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,280
No.

89
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,280
I can't live down there in the village.

90
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,280
And Heidi can't either.

91
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,280
We belong here, in this little hut.

92
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,280
That's the way it is.

93
00:08:28,768 --> 00:08:32,768
Down there in the village, it's too narrow and too small for a man like me.

94
00:08:35,768 --> 00:08:36,768
Well...

95
00:08:36,768 --> 00:08:39,768
I can't do anything with the people who live there.

96
00:08:39,768 --> 00:08:41,768
I'm sorry.

97
00:08:41,768 --> 00:08:43,768
I hate you and you hate me.

98
00:08:43,768 --> 00:08:45,768
And that will always be the case.

99
00:08:45,768 --> 00:08:47,768
You think I'm crazy.

100
00:08:47,768 --> 00:08:49,768
But that doesn't matter to me anymore.

101
00:08:49,768 --> 00:08:51,768
I've met them.

102
00:08:51,768 --> 00:08:53,768
Every single one of them.

103
00:08:53,768 --> 00:08:55,768
I'm sorry, they don't understand.

104
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:57,750
And what's worse, no heart.

105
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:07,750
You judge too strictly, my brother. It may sometimes have the appearance, you
must not forget, they say, not for nothing, in a raw shell often rests a soft
core.

106
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:13,550
Believe me, but if you come to them, they will come to you.

107
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:19,150
You were the one who turned away from them. Have you ever had a friendly word
for them?

108
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:26,550
Believe me, you take the first step, my brother, and they will come to you and
take you with open arms.

109
00:09:26,569 --> 00:09:30,569
Be careful, AlmÃ¶hi, you are the wiser one.

110
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:35,569
For only those who can be weak can show their true strength, and you are strong.

111
00:09:37,569 --> 00:09:39,569
Give me your hand in friendship.

112
00:09:39,569 --> 00:09:41,569
Believe me, I know the people.

113
00:09:41,569 --> 00:09:43,569
I know what is good for you and for Heidi.

114
00:09:43,569 --> 00:09:46,569
Take the child with you down to our village.

115
00:09:54,547 --> 00:10:00,547
I thank you for the time you have sacrificed and I know how to appreciate what
you want to do for us.

116
00:10:00,547 --> 00:10:05,547
But unfortunately I have to renounce. Neither Heidi nor I will send you into the
village.

117
00:10:05,547 --> 00:10:07,547
I will not send you to your school.

118
00:10:09,547 --> 00:10:12,547
Neighbor, neighbor, you are making a mistake.

119
00:10:24,467 --> 00:10:26,467
Is the conversation over?

120
00:10:28,467 --> 00:10:30,467
Aren't you staying with us for lunch?

121
00:10:32,467 --> 00:10:37,467
Tell me, my child, don't you sometimes feel very lonely here with your
grandfather alone?

122
00:10:37,467 --> 00:10:39,467
No, not a little bit.

123
00:10:40,467 --> 00:10:42,467
Why are you looking at me like that all of a sudden?

124
00:10:42,467 --> 00:10:44,467
Oh, nothing, nothing special.

125
00:10:44,467 --> 00:10:47,467
Goodbye, little one, take care.

126
00:10:51,467 --> 00:10:52,467
Goodbye!

127
00:10:52,467 --> 00:10:54,467
We will!

128
00:10:59,987 --> 00:11:02,987
So, Grandfather, now he's gone. Tell me.

129
00:11:05,987 --> 00:11:08,987
Was it something nice for us or not so nice?

130
00:11:15,987 --> 00:11:17,987
Well?

131
00:11:19,315 --> 00:11:22,315
So it wasn't that nice.

132
00:11:36,435 --> 00:11:38,435
Grandfather?

133
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:43,435
How can you just call the goats now?

134
00:11:51,603 --> 00:11:55,603
If you don't want to say it on your own, can I guess it?

135
00:11:57,603 --> 00:12:00,603
Yes? I'll just try it now.

136
00:12:00,603 --> 00:12:03,603
He wanted to sell us a new goat, a five-legged one.

137
00:12:03,603 --> 00:12:05,603
You have to say something too.

138
00:12:05,603 --> 00:12:09,603
That's no fun. If one is running, the other has to say hot or cold.

139
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,603
It's none of your business.

140
00:12:11,603 --> 00:12:13,603
But why not?

141
00:12:46,370 --> 00:13:00,370
1, 0, 9, 11, 7, Heaven, Hell, 9...

142
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:04,646
If you don't want to talk to me, you should let it go. One, two...

143
00:13:14,646 --> 00:13:19,646
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

144
00:13:19,718 --> 00:13:24,718
And he talked to the old man like to a sick horse, and what should I tell you,
completely senseless.

145
00:13:24,718 --> 00:13:26,718
So he doesn't send her to school?

146
00:13:26,718 --> 00:13:27,718
Yes, exactly.

147
00:13:27,718 --> 00:13:31,718
That looks like him. The teacher climbs the mountain to talk to him, and what do
you do?

148
00:13:31,718 --> 00:13:33,718
You just reject him.

149
00:13:33,718 --> 00:13:39,718
You know what? Before he went up to his inn, he even walked door to door with
our teacher.

150
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:40,718
Yes, that's right.

151
00:13:40,718 --> 00:13:44,718
What will happen to the child if he doesn't let it go to school? You can't just
watch it like that.

152
00:13:44,718 --> 00:13:45,708
Yes, exactly.

153
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:50,508
I totally agree with you. We'll have to come up with something, and then he has
to do it.

154
00:13:50,508 --> 00:13:55,208
The only question is what we should come up with. I can't think of anything at
times like this.

155
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,208
There's a car.

156
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:06,470
My luggage is downstairs. Now I don't have to walk that far.

157
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,470
The rest is for you. Thank you.

158
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,470
Thank you too.

159
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,470
She's from the city.

160
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,470
You can see that.

161
00:14:17,286 --> 00:14:19,286
Did you see what she was wearing?

162
00:14:19,286 --> 00:14:20,286
I only know that from the newspaper.

163
00:14:20,286 --> 00:14:21,286
Me too.

164
00:14:22,286 --> 00:14:23,286
It works.

165
00:14:23,286 --> 00:14:24,286
Who can it be?

166
00:14:24,286 --> 00:14:26,286
Did you invite someone else that I don't know anything about?

167
00:14:28,286 --> 00:14:31,286
Maybe it's the priest who's still coming.

168
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:41,630
Good day, Aunt Barbel. May I come in?

169
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,630
- Dete, that can't be true. - No, no, no.

170
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,630
And you're here too, as you used to be.

171
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:51,630
Indeed, Dete, let me look at you, my child.

172
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,630
I'm so happy to see you.

173
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,630
- This feather of the abode. - Welcome.

174
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,630
- I'm glad you're here. - Thank you.

175
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,630
- You look wonderful. - Thank you.

176
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,630
Let me hug you, too, Dete.

177
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:05,630
I haven't seen you in so long, my child.

178
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:09,151
You've become a fine lady, right out of town.

179
00:15:09,151 --> 00:15:13,351
How is it here in the village? Is everything still as it was not so long ago?

180
00:15:13,351 --> 00:15:16,711
Dete, the young girl from the village, had changed a lot.

181
00:15:16,711 --> 00:15:22,431
A lot of time had passed since she had entrusted her niece Heidi, the daughter-
in-law of the AlmÃ¶hi.

182
00:15:22,431 --> 00:15:26,191
She didn't like it, but she had no other choice.

183
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:31,591
Here in the village she found no work. The only place she was offered was in
Frankfurt.

184
00:15:31,591 --> 00:15:35,931
And what was she supposed to do alone in the big city with Heidi?

185
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,935
Now she was back.

186
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:45,575
I interrupted you. When I arrived, you had just talked to each other.

187
00:15:47,215 --> 00:15:50,795
Yes, yes, exactly. And everything is your fault.

188
00:15:52,455 --> 00:15:57,255
If you hadn't necessarily had to go through your head back then, we would have
had a lot less trouble today.

189
00:15:57,255 --> 00:16:01,095
And who knows what it's good for you to have come today?

190
00:16:01,407 --> 00:16:03,107
Again, I can't follow you.

191
00:16:03,107 --> 00:16:06,527
What am I to blame for? What have I done? I haven't been here all these years.

192
00:16:06,527 --> 00:16:11,527
If you had given us some advice back then, Heidi wouldn't have had to go through
all this.

193
00:16:11,527 --> 00:16:15,527
Go through? What do you mean, Heidi? Is she sick? Or is she injured?

194
00:16:15,527 --> 00:16:18,787
No, she's not. She's not sick, but she's injured.

195
00:16:18,787 --> 00:16:20,407
Is he treating her badly?

196
00:16:20,407 --> 00:16:22,247
No, he loves her warmly and tenderly.

197
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:26,407
But that's the way it is. He doesn't want to hand her over. He won't let her go
to school.

198
00:16:26,407 --> 00:16:28,407
He won't let her go to school?

199
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:32,799
She doesn't even know the alphabet, and she can't count either.

200
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:35,799
She's already eight years old. How is that supposed to go on with her?

201
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:37,799
She doesn't even know where right and left is.

202
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:39,799
We've even sent the pastor to him.

203
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:43,799
I understand. You see, he's still exactly the same as he used to be.

204
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:46,799
It's a wonder that he even gives the child something to eat.

205
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:49,799
She's supposed to have become so nice and pretty.

206
00:16:51,823 --> 00:16:53,823
Do you have a cup of coffee for me?

207
00:16:53,823 --> 00:16:56,823
I will then tell you something that you still have to keep for yourself.

208
00:16:56,823 --> 00:16:59,823
I think your worries are over from today.

209
00:16:59,823 --> 00:17:00,823
What?

210
00:17:00,823 --> 00:17:03,823
Tell me, does that have anything to do with you and the child?

211
00:17:04,287 --> 00:17:07,647
first a cup of coffee and then I'll tell you all about it

212
00:17:07,647 --> 00:17:10,687
but first sit down at the table

213
00:17:10,687 --> 00:17:11,887
but what?

214
00:17:11,887 --> 00:17:13,887
Tete, don't make it so exciting

215
00:17:13,887 --> 00:17:15,247
tell us right now

216
00:17:15,247 --> 00:17:17,247
no, no, no, eat the coffee

217
00:17:17,247 --> 00:17:20,247
she has a long journey behind her and will be tired

218
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:23,087
of course, how can you be so heartless?

219
00:17:23,087 --> 00:17:25,087
I even like to make the coffee

220
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:27,087
nice

221
00:17:27,103 --> 00:17:30,663
if you know how happy I was at home

222
00:17:30,663 --> 00:17:32,743
we are lucky, there was still something in the kitchen

223
00:17:32,743 --> 00:17:35,183
hopefully you saw if it's still warm

224
00:17:35,183 --> 00:17:36,343
it will be

225
00:17:36,343 --> 00:17:39,103
don't we have a piece of cake for the celebration of the day?

226
00:17:39,103 --> 00:17:41,623
no, unfortunately not, then I'll have a good time

227
00:17:57,103 --> 00:18:03,223
subscribe to the channel

228
00:18:03,276 --> 00:18:06,276
* Music *

229
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:26,060
Grandfather, may I visit Peter's grandmother today?

230
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,060
I'm thinking about it.

231
00:18:30,648 --> 00:18:32,648
One, two, three, go!

232
00:19:00,648 --> 00:19:01,740
One, two, three...

233
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:08,740
1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 12, 5, 6, 8, stop.

234
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:13,740
1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, stop.

235
00:19:14,124 --> 00:19:25,124
Twelve, fifteen, twenty-eight, one, two, three, four, seven, nine, a hundred,
twelve.

236
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,124
Good day, Heidi. How are you?

237
00:19:32,124 --> 00:19:35,124
Don't you recognize me anymore, Heidi?

238
00:19:35,124 --> 00:19:37,124
Yes, of course. You are Aunt Dete.

239
00:19:37,124 --> 00:19:39,124
How tall you are!

240
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:45,330
You are heavier too. Let me take a look at you. You look good and you've got
nice red cheeks. How nice.

241
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:49,330
Tell me, are you doing well, my child? - Yes.

242
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:53,330
Is your grandfather at home? - Yes, of course. He's in the hut. I'll go and tell
him.

243
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:55,330
No, Heidi, wait. - Why?

244
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:59,330
Just like that. - It's better for you if you wait outside.

245
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:02,330
Or not. Let me think about it.

246
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:07,330
No, you can stay with us. It's a surprise for you.

247
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,330
Yes, of course.

248
00:20:11,404 --> 00:20:14,404
Grandfather, we've got visitors again. Tell us who they are.

249
00:20:17,404 --> 00:20:19,404
Good day, AlmÃ¶hi.

250
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:29,476
Why are you laughing? What's so funny?

251
00:20:29,476 --> 00:20:32,476
You wiped the floor with your long skirt.

252
00:20:32,476 --> 00:20:33,476
It's good for cleaning.

253
00:20:33,476 --> 00:20:34,476
What?

254
00:20:38,476 --> 00:20:41,476
That's okay. My skirt isn't that important right now.

255
00:20:41,476 --> 00:20:44,476
I brought good news for you.

256
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:47,476
We can use good news.

257
00:20:48,476 --> 00:20:53,476
Now I almost forgot that I brought you something from the city.

258
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:58,180
Here, sweets for you.

259
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,180
Thank you.

260
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,180
Look at me.

261
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:10,180
I brought you tobacco. I hope you like the taste.

262
00:21:16,543 --> 00:21:20,543
I want to thank you. You were very good to Heidi.

263
00:21:20,543 --> 00:21:23,543
You can see how happy she was here.

264
00:21:24,543 --> 00:21:27,543
Heidi, let us in for a moment, okay?

265
00:21:27,543 --> 00:21:29,543
Yes, of course.

266
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:36,543
So you still haven't given up on me.

267
00:21:36,543 --> 00:21:38,543
I had no other choice then.

268
00:21:38,543 --> 00:21:41,543
You were the only one I could trust.

269
00:21:41,543 --> 00:21:44,543
I knew you could handle children.

270
00:21:46,543 --> 00:21:49,543
You were the only one I could trust.

271
00:21:50,975 --> 00:21:55,975
I think you thought I'd give them to you and then forget, but that's not true.

272
00:21:55,975 --> 00:22:00,975
I haven't forgotten them for a minute. I've had to think of them every day and
every night.

273
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:14,599
I know it was hard for you, but now I'm finally so far that I can help you.

274
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:19,599
I know it took a long time, but now I've finally come to pick them up.

275
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:22,599
What did you say?

276
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:25,599
I'll take them with me.

277
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:30,599
I'll take them with me to Frankfurt.

278
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:39,647
One for you, and one for me.

279
00:22:41,647 --> 00:22:45,647
From now on, Heidi had to start a completely different life.

280
00:22:45,647 --> 00:22:48,647
She had to say goodbye to her beloved mountains.

281
00:22:50,647 --> 00:22:54,647
Dete took her with her without really understanding what had happened to her.

282
00:22:54,647 --> 00:22:58,647
And Peter and Joseph no longer understood the world.

283
00:22:58,647 --> 00:23:01,647
Heidi was curious about the big city of Frankfurt,

284
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:01,973
and she had to find a way to get out of it.

285
00:23:01,973 --> 00:23:06,173
But the farewell of her friends was incredibly difficult for her.

286
00:23:06,173 --> 00:23:08,173
When would they all see each other again?

287
00:23:08,173 --> 00:23:19,173
Joseph, the faithful Bernardine, her beloved mountains, the children down in the
village, the little church, the colorful houses, and above all, when would she
see her grandfather again?

288
00:23:20,173 --> 00:23:25,173
Peter, in any case, had a huge rage over everyone who had taken away Heidi from
him.

289
00:23:25,173 --> 00:23:29,173
But we want to tell you about this in our next story.

290
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:57,867
âª Heidi, Heidi, your world is the mountains. Heidi, Heidi, because up here you
are at home. Heidi, Heidi, come home, find your happiness, come back home. âª

291
00:23:59,867 --> 00:24:00,920
Thanks for watching!
