Holadio

00:00:12,494 --> 00:00:17,494
Holadio

00:00:20,494 --> 00:00:24,494
Heidi, Heidi

4
00:00:24,494 --> 00:00:28,494
Your world are the mountains

5
00:00:28,494 --> 00:00:32,494
Heidi, Heidi

6
00:00:32,494 --> 00:00:36,494
Because up here you are at home

7
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:40,494
Dark firs

8
00:00:40,494 --> 00:00:44,494
Green meadows in the sunshine

9
00:00:44,494 --> 00:00:48,494
Heidi, Heidi

10
00:00:48,494 --> 00:00:52,494
You need to be happy

11
00:00:52,494 --> 00:00:55,494
Holadio, Holadio, Holadio

12
00:00:55,494 --> 00:00:58,494
Holadio, Holadio, Holadio

00:00:58,494 --> 00:01:01,494
Holadio, Holadio, Holadio

00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:02,494
Holadio

Holadio, Holadio, Holadio

Heidi, Heidi

18
00:01:09,494 --> 00:01:11,494
Come home

19
00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:14,494
Find your happiness

20
00:01:14,494 --> 00:01:19,494
Come back home

21
00:01:19,494 --> 00:01:37,494
Peter, faster! Where are you staying so long?

22
00:01:41,466 --> 00:01:46,066
Heidi and Peter went up to their favorite pasture with the goats this morning

23
00:01:46,066 --> 00:01:48,966
For Heidi everything seemed to be the same as always

24
00:01:48,966 --> 00:01:51,466
She was happy and unharmed

25
00:01:54,966 --> 00:01:57,466
Peter on the other hand was very worried

26
00:01:57,466 --> 00:02:00,966
If I only knew how to teach her that again

27
00:02:01,862 --> 00:02:20,862
Snooki, watch out! You're tearing a hole in your skirt! Watch out!

28
00:02:20,862 --> 00:02:26,862
Snooki!

29
00:02:26,862 --> 00:02:30,862
Is there really nothing else for you besides this goat?

30
00:02:30,862 --> 00:02:35,862
And besides, I'm here to eat and not to play! You should know that!

31
00:02:35,862 --> 00:02:39,738
What's wrong with you, Peter? You're not that angry!

32
00:02:39,738 --> 00:02:41,738
Come on, tell me!

33
00:02:41,738 --> 00:02:43,738
It doesn't concern you?

34
00:02:43,738 --> 00:02:45,738
Of course it concerns me. I'm your girlfriend.

35
00:02:45,738 --> 00:02:47,738
You're just making that up!

36
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,338
You're weird.

37
00:02:53,338 --> 00:03:00,338
Peter was not angry, he was worried. He wanted to tell Heidi something and did
not know how.

38
00:03:00,338 --> 00:03:03,338
This morning he had heard something down in Durflea.

39
00:03:03,338 --> 00:03:05,338
I'm sorry I'm late.

40
00:03:05,338 --> 00:03:07,338
Don't worry, Snuggie is not there yet.

41
00:03:07,338 --> 00:03:11,338
Didn't anyone tell you that she won't come with us today?

42
00:03:11,338 --> 00:03:13,338
Yes, why is that all of a sudden?

43
00:03:13,338 --> 00:03:18,338
I already thought that you were scared when you heard it. You can imagine what
will happen. She is to be sold.

44
00:03:19,515 --> 00:03:21,515
No! Why?

45
00:03:21,515 --> 00:03:23,515
I don't know. I haven't heard anything.

46
00:03:23,515 --> 00:03:25,515
She will come after all.

47
00:03:25,515 --> 00:03:27,515
- Good morning. - Here we are.

48
00:03:27,515 --> 00:03:29,515
Greetings, Peter.

49
00:03:31,515 --> 00:03:33,515
Is it true that you want to sell Schnucki?

50
00:03:33,515 --> 00:03:35,515
Yes.

51
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:37,515
Then you already know. I can't keep her anymore.

52
00:03:37,515 --> 00:03:39,515
It's her last summer.

53
00:03:39,515 --> 00:03:41,515
She grows and doesn't grow.

54
00:03:41,515 --> 00:03:43,515
That doesn't matter.

55
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:45,515
It takes longer with her. She will grow.

56
00:03:45,515 --> 00:03:47,515
I don't think so.

57
00:03:47,515 --> 00:03:49,515
Don't eat and don't give milk.

58
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:43,709
Peter, back there on the rock, what is he looking for?

59
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:47,709
Peter, what have you found? Show me.

60
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:50,709
Some herbs. Please take them.

61
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:52,709
Let them fall.

62
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,709
I've got them. They smell really good.

63
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:57,709
And what are we going to do with the herbs now?

64
00:05:01,413 --> 00:05:05,413
Now I don't understand you at all. What's going on with you?

65
00:05:05,413 --> 00:05:12,413
First you yell at me because I play with Schnucki and then you climb up the
rocks yourself and harvest some herbs for her.

66
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:14,413
Come on, let's go eat.

67
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:17,413
What's wrong with you?

68
00:05:21,349 --> 00:05:23,349
Did you have a bad night's sleep?

69
00:05:28,101 --> 00:05:30,101
I never sleep well.

70
00:05:30,101 --> 00:05:33,101
But still, you have something today.

71
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:36,101
You're as bad-tempered as ever. I don't even know you like that.

72
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:38,101
What does it matter to you how I am?

73
00:05:41,101 --> 00:05:42,405
Peter, what's going on today?

74
00:05:42,405 --> 00:05:46,405
Don't you want to tell me why you're in such a bad mood?

75
00:05:49,405 --> 00:05:51,405
I have to tell you at some point.

76
00:05:51,405 --> 00:05:53,405
What do you have to tell me?

77
00:05:53,405 --> 00:05:55,405
Schnucki is being sold.

78
00:05:55,405 --> 00:05:57,405
Sold? Our Schnucki?

79
00:05:57,405 --> 00:06:00,405
Yes, our Schnucki is being sold to the butchers.

80
00:06:00,405 --> 00:06:03,405
No, I don't believe that. I just don't believe that.

81
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:06,405
You can't allow that. We can't allow that.

82
00:06:06,405 --> 00:06:08,405
We can't do anything.

83
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:11,478
They say she doesn't grow.

84
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:13,478
That's why she would never give me milk.

85
00:06:13,478 --> 00:06:15,478
Believe me, it's pointless.

86
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:17,478
I won't let that happen. They can't do that.

87
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:19,478
Why won't you think of anything, Peter?

88
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:21,478
Why don't you think about it?

89
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:23,056
Snuggie is my favorite goat.

90
00:06:23,056 --> 00:06:28,056
What do you think I'm doing? I don't care. I don't know what to do.

91
00:06:28,056 --> 00:06:33,056
No, you can't do that. It can't be. It just can't be.

92
00:06:33,056 --> 00:06:36,444
I like Snuggie so much. Doesn't it bother you at all?

93
00:06:36,444 --> 00:06:39,684
Of course it does! Do you think I'm made of wood?

94
00:06:45,044 --> 00:06:46,684
Poor Snuggie, poor Snuggie.

95
00:06:46,884 --> 00:06:48,364
You're not allowed to do that.

96
00:06:48,564 --> 00:06:51,364
You're not allowed to do that. I won't let you do that.

97

98
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,960
They want to sell Schnucki to a butcher.

99
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,960
Why don't you say anything?

100
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,960
I told you that something was wrong with you.

101
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,960
You make a face like it's going to rain.

102
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,960
I just told you something. Did you really listen to me?

103
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,960
Schnucki is being killed and you're making a face like it's going to rain.

104
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,960
Yes, I'm doing that.

105
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,960
In the countryside, goats are kept to milk them and not to love them.

106
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,960
Goats have to give milk.

107
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:45,302
- No, no, no, no, no. - But, Heidi, it can't be changed.

108
00:07:45,502 --> 00:07:49,702
We keep the goats to give them milk, and then we make cheese out of it.

109
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:52,702
And then we sell the cheese or exchange it.

110
00:07:52,902 --> 00:07:57,902
- Where else should we live? - I don't care where we live!

112
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:26,560
Heidi, go to bed now. It's late.

113
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,560
Heidi, I talked to you.

114
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,560
You can't do anything to him, grandfather. You know everything else.

115
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,560
No, Heidi, not this time.

116
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,560
Schnucki doesn't belong to us and I don't have the right to interfere.

117
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,560
There are things you have to deal with.

118
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,040
Oh, calm down, Heidi.

119
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,540
I don't even think about calming myself down.

120
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,080
Sometimes you have to be able to make an exception.

121
00:09:18,363 --> 00:09:22,363
Snooki, come here, come!

122
00:09:23,431 --> 00:09:25,431
No, don't hit me!

123
00:09:28,431 --> 00:09:31,431
No, don't! Stay here! Don't take me away!

124
00:09:32,431 --> 00:09:33,431
No, no!

125
00:09:34,431 --> 00:09:35,431
Schnucki!

126
00:09:36,431 --> 00:09:39,431
It's my goat! Where are you taking it?

127
00:09:40,431 --> 00:09:42,431
You can't do that! No!

128
00:09:50,431 --> 00:09:51,431
Schnucki!

129
00:09:53,431 --> 00:09:54,431
Schnucki, stay with me!

130
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,431
Heidi!

131
00:09:55,431 --> 00:09:56,431
Heidi!

132
00:10:02,431 --> 00:10:03,431
Heidi!

133
00:10:05,431 --> 00:10:07,431
Come here, my child.

134
00:10:13,819 --> 00:10:17,219
- They took her away. - No, no one was taken away yet.

135
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:19,619
You just had a bad dream, Heidi.

136
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,219
A strange man beat her and pulled her away.

137
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:24,419
Be quiet, child.

138
00:10:24,619 --> 00:10:27,419
Possible. Maybe it was just a dream today.

139
00:10:27,619 --> 00:10:29,419
But that's just the way it is.

140
00:10:29,619 --> 00:10:32,619
- Drink this, then you'll feel better. - Thank you.

141
00:10:38,843 --> 00:10:40,843
Should I get you another cup?

142
00:10:40,843 --> 00:10:43,843
No, you can't do anything.

143
00:10:44,843 --> 00:10:46,843
You really don't like it, grandfather?

144
00:10:46,843 --> 00:10:48,843
Not even if you really think about it?

145
00:10:48,843 --> 00:10:50,843
It can't be!

146
00:10:51,843 --> 00:10:54,843
There's only one way to help.

147
00:10:54,843 --> 00:10:56,843
We have to improve the milk.

148
00:10:56,843 --> 00:10:57,843
Is that possible?

149
00:10:57,843 --> 00:11:00,843
I can't promise you anything, but we'll try.

150
00:11:00,843 --> 00:11:03,843
What do we have to do? Tell me!

151
00:11:03,843 --> 00:11:05,843
Feed her if she doesn't want to eat.

152
00:11:05,843 --> 00:11:06,843
You think she'll take it?

153
00:11:06,843 --> 00:11:07,793
Yes.

154
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:10,793
She'll definitely take it from you. She likes you and she trusts you.

155
00:11:10,793 --> 00:11:13,793
But look for the best herbs and the freshest grass for her.

156
00:11:13,793 --> 00:11:15,793
Peter picked herbs.

157
00:11:15,793 --> 00:11:18,793
That's good. Yes, Peter understands what goats are.

158
00:11:18,793 --> 00:11:21,793
The herbs that grow the most are the best.

159
00:11:21,793 --> 00:11:25,793
I know what you mean. You mean the herbs with the wide leaves that smell so
good.

160
00:11:25,793 --> 00:11:28,793
They grow so high that the goats don't even get close to them.

161
00:11:28,793 --> 00:11:31,793
Leave the grass to Peter.

162
00:11:31,793 --> 00:11:34,609
I don't want you to fall off in the end.

163
00:11:34,609 --> 00:11:38,609
Peter grew up here in the mountains. He almost looks better than the Gems.

164
00:11:38,609 --> 00:11:42,609
Now go to sleep, but we'll do it somehow.

165
00:11:42,609 --> 00:11:46,609
I was right, wasn't I? If you really think about it, something always comes to
mind.

166
00:11:46,609 --> 00:11:48,609
We can only hope that it was the right thing to do.

167
00:11:48,609 --> 00:11:52,609
Oh yes, I think so, for sure. And now I can finally go to sleep.

168
00:11:52,609 --> 00:11:54,609
Good night and thank you very much.

169
00:12:03,334 --> 00:12:10,334
The next morning Heidi told Peter everything that she and the grandfather had
discussed the evening before

170
00:12:10,334 --> 00:12:14,334
And the two children decided to help Snooki

171
00:12:16,334 --> 00:12:19,334
There's one growing up there, that's exactly what the grandfather wanted

172
00:12:19,334 --> 00:12:20,334
That's way too steep!

173
00:12:20,334 --> 00:12:22,334
Oh what? That's not steep at all

174
00:12:22,334 --> 00:12:24,334
Stay here, you'll fall down

175
00:12:24,334 --> 00:12:30,334
Heidi of course didn't ask the grandfather to climb on his own

176
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:32,334
She wanted to help Snooki

177
00:12:32,716 --> 00:12:37,116
And what Heidi had put in her head, she didn't give up so quickly

178
00:12:38,098 --> 00:12:43,098
So, I knew it! Now you're stuck! You have to hold on to the left!

179
00:12:43,098 --> 00:12:45,098
And how do I know where the left is?

180
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:49,098
There, of course! On the side where the herbs grow!

181
00:12:51,098 --> 00:12:54,098
I can't reach it! My arm is too short!

182
00:12:58,098 --> 00:13:01,098
Why don't you help me? Hurry up!

183
00:13:01,098 --> 00:13:02,098
How?

184
00:13:02,098 --> 00:13:04,098
I don't know! Let me think of something!

185
00:13:04,098 --> 00:13:07,098
Fine, I'll come! But it's the last time!

186
00:13:08,098 --> 00:13:09,098
I don't know!

187
00:13:09,702 --> 00:13:11,702
Now be careful!

188
00:13:13,702 --> 00:13:15,702
Slowly! Watch out!

189
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,790
What the hell do you think you're doing?

190
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,990
Can't you listen to what other people say?

191
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,990
That didn't sound that steep.

192
00:13:37,542 --> 00:13:40,542
You don't believe what I found back there.

193
00:13:43,542 --> 00:13:45,542
Well, what do you say?

194
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:46,542
Nothing.

195
00:13:49,542 --> 00:13:51,542
Is something wrong?

196
00:13:51,542 --> 00:13:53,542
These are others.

197
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:55,542
These are the right ones.

198
00:14:26,306 --> 00:14:28,306
* Music *

199
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:40,030
Heidi and Peter worked hard. The whole long day they climbed around the rocks
and picked fresh herbs for Schnucki

200
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:47,030
In the evening, when the sun went down, Heidi was so tired that she could hardly
put one foot in front of the other

201
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:54,030
But still she was very, very happy. She was firmly convinced that she could save
Schnucki with Peter's help

202
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,145
The end

203
00:15:04,145 --> 00:15:06,145
What is it, Heidi?

204
00:15:06,145 --> 00:15:08,145
Are you suddenly sick?

205
00:15:08,145 --> 00:15:10,145
I'm just tired, that's all.

206
00:15:10,145 --> 00:15:13,145
Where's Schnucki? She's gone, I can't see her anymore.

207
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,145
There she is.

208
00:15:17,145 --> 00:15:19,145
Thank God.

209
00:15:24,145 --> 00:15:26,145
Thank you.

210
00:15:30,545 --> 00:15:34,545
You look very tired. She probably didn't take a break today, did she?

211
00:15:35,545 --> 00:15:39,545
You know her. She won't rest until she's picked up the last grain.

212
00:15:39,545 --> 00:15:41,545
Take good care of her.

213
00:15:42,545 --> 00:15:45,545
I think I'll give you Joseph from tomorrow.

214
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:47,545
He'll make sure nothing happens to you.

215
00:15:47,545 --> 00:15:49,545
Good. That'll help me a bit.

216
00:15:49,545 --> 00:15:51,545
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

217
00:15:52,545 --> 00:15:53,545
Heidi!

218
00:15:53,545 --> 00:15:54,545
I don't see her.

219
00:15:54,545 --> 00:15:55,545
Heidi!

220
00:15:55,545 --> 00:15:56,545
Heidi!

221
00:16:00,545 --> 00:16:01,545
Heidi!

222
00:16:13,545 --> 00:16:14,321
Heidi!

223
00:16:14,321 --> 00:16:17,321
She seems to have exaggerated again, as always.

224
00:16:22,865 --> 00:16:24,865
See you tomorrow.

225

226
00:16:57,009 --> 00:17:01,509
The moose obeyed his promise and gave Joseph the next day.

227
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:03,509
That was a great help for Peter.

228
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:07,009
He knew that under Joseph's protection his herd of goats was safe.

229
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:10,509
And so he could look for the herbs with Heidi in peace.

230
00:17:17,553 --> 00:17:20,553
Look, there are a lot of them.

231
00:17:21,553 --> 00:17:23,553
Come on, Schnucki, quick!

232
00:17:23,553 --> 00:17:25,553
There's none left, you have to eat them all.

233
00:17:25,553 --> 00:17:27,553
That's very nice.

234
00:17:30,553 --> 00:17:32,553
Peter, did you hurt yourself?

235
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:35,553
What? Say something, Peter!

236
00:17:35,793 --> 00:17:38,793
Is it very bad, Peter? Does it hurt?

237
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,793
You've found some too.

238
00:17:42,793 --> 00:17:45,793
You think I'm just a fun-climber?

239
00:17:45,793 --> 00:17:47,793
Here, Snuggie, for you.

240
00:17:48,793 --> 00:17:49,793
Thank you.

241
00:17:51,793 --> 00:17:54,793
But you're bleeding on your knee. Does it hurt?

242
00:17:54,793 --> 00:17:55,793
No, not at all.

243
00:17:55,793 --> 00:17:58,793
The main thing is that it tastes good. The knee is not bad.

244
00:17:59,793 --> 00:18:01,793
What you always think of...

245
00:18:01,793 --> 00:18:04,793
I learned that from the dogs. They always do that.

246
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:05,826
What you always think of...

247
00:18:05,826 --> 00:18:07,826
Come with me, Snuggie, come!

248
00:18:07,826 --> 00:18:15,826
Heidi and Peter had decided to help Snuggie and they were not tired of looking
for fresh herbs and feeding Snuggie with them.

249
00:18:15,826 --> 00:18:21,826
And every time the alpine ewe climbed the mountains to hit wood, he did not
leave the little goat either.

250
00:18:24,826 --> 00:18:29,826
Thank you, grandfather. Here, Snuggie, this is for you. Here, eat.

251
00:18:29,922 --> 00:18:35,442
So it went on for many days. But then it started to rain all of a sudden and she
didn't want to stop again.

252
00:18:35,442 --> 00:18:41,482
Heidi was very worried. Who would give Snuggie the herbs she needed to grow and
become strong?

253
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:56,708
Heidi, don't lose your mind. She's going to grow up, I know that.

254
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,708
Is that really true?

255
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,708
Yes, I think she's over the mountain.

256
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:02,708
That would be nice.

257
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,708
Grandfather!

258
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:05,708
Yes, what is it?

259
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:08,708
Give it to me. I'll carry it for you.

260
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:14,708
You know what? When I was stroking Schnucki, she felt a little bit fatter.

261
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,708
Oh, you see?

262
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:20,690
The summer was slowly coming to an end.

263
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:24,490
The days were getting colder, and it was already very often foggy.

264
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,290
Sometimes you could hardly see your hand in front of your eyes.

265
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:31,090
It was far too dangerous to do large climbs.

266
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,490
But they look so good. We have to get them.

267
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,890
No, we won't get them. They stay where they are.

268
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,690
It's far too small and far too high.

269
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:40,490
Come on, we'll turn around. It doesn't make sense.

270

Subtitles by Stephanie Geiges

271
00:19:51,548 --> 00:19:55,748
But Schnucki hasn't had any of the herbs for so long.

272
00:20:25,752 --> 00:20:27,752
*Sigh*

273
00:20:35,996 --> 00:20:37,996
There they are!

274
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,760
- Heidi! - Peter, help me!

275
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,760
Heidi, hold on! Hold on tight!

276
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,760
Hurry! I can't take it anymore!

277
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,760
Don't let go!

278
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,760
Don't let go!

279
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,760
Just hold on one more moment!

280
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,760
I can't take it anymore! Hurry!

281
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,760
You have to, Ken! Here, take my hand!

282
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,760
It won't work!

283
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,760
Yes, it will!

284
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,760
Careful! Hold on tight!

285
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,760
I'm scared!

286
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,760
Don't let go!

287
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,760
I know!

288
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,760
Hold on tight!

289
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,760
You can do it!

290
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,760
Come on.

291
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,760
You're gonna make it, hi!

292
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,760
Come on!

293
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,760
Do it!

294
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,760
You don't want to lose me?

295
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,760
I'm gonna get you!

296
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,760
Come on!

297
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,760
Let go!

298
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,407
Don't let go!

299
00:22:34,407 --> 00:22:38,407
If we didn't have it, then we wouldn't be so happy now

300
00:22:38,407 --> 00:22:42,407
She had stung her foot and had scratches and blue spots everywhere

301
00:22:42,407 --> 00:22:45,407
But Heidi didn't mind that the least

302
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:48,407
The main thing was that she could help Schnucki

303
00:22:49,407 --> 00:22:53,407
The next day she was back on her feet and climbed the rocks up and down

304
00:22:53,407 --> 00:22:57,407
And she didn't get tired of looking for fresh herbs for the little goat

305
00:22:57,407 --> 00:23:00,407
The best was just good enough for Schnucki

306
00:23:00,407 --> 00:23:02,093
And so she went deeper and deeper into the forest

307
00:23:02,093 --> 00:23:07,293
She climbed the mountain higher and higher and discovered areas that she didn't
even know

308
00:23:09,533 --> 00:23:14,813
Peter accompanied her every day and tried to be even more careful with his
careless girlfriend

309
00:23:14,813 --> 00:23:17,613
But all the effort seemed to be for nothing

310
00:23:17,613 --> 00:23:21,213
The news he brought from the village wasn't always good

311
00:23:21,213 --> 00:23:23,693
But Heidi didn't give up hope

312
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:27,133
But we want to tell you about that in our next story

313
00:23:28,019 --> 00:23:31,759
Heidi, Heidi

314
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:35,759
Your world are the mountains

315
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:39,759
Heidi, Heidi

316
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:43,759
Because up here you are at home

317
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:47,759
Heidi, Heidi

318
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,759
Come home

319
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:51,759
Find your happiness

320
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:56,759
Come back again

321
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,320
Thanks for watching!
