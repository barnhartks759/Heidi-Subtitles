00:00:00,026 --> 00:00:03,026
This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to anyone, living or dead, is
coincidental and unintentional.

2
00:00:03,398 --> 00:00:13,398
It is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to anyone, living or dead, is
coincidental and unintentional.

3
00:00:33,398 --> 00:00:52,398
Up here you are at home. Dark pebbles, green meadows in the sunshine. Heidi,
Heidi, you need to be happy.

4
00:00:52,398 --> 00:01:01,398
Halala Edie, Halala Edie, Halala Edie, Halala Edie, Halala Edie, Halala Edie,
Halala Edie, Halala Edie, Halala Edie.

5
00:01:01,398 --> 00:01:02,398
Halala Edie.

6
00:01:03,398 --> 00:01:18,398
Heidi, Heidi, come home. Find your happiness. Come back again.

7
00:01:24,826 --> 00:01:26,826
Where should she sleep?

8
00:01:26,826 --> 00:01:29,826
Can we make her bed out of hay, like mine, under the roof?

9
00:01:30,826 --> 00:01:32,826
Peter is whistling, I have to talk to him.

10
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,826
Svenli, Merli, Peter is coming!

11
00:01:35,826 --> 00:01:37,826
Good morning, little ghost.

12
00:01:40,826 --> 00:01:42,826
Peter, did you bring a letter?

13
00:01:43,098 --> 00:01:45,098
Oh dear, it's starting again.

14
00:01:45,098 --> 00:01:47,098
Tell me, do you have one with you today?

15
00:01:47,098 --> 00:01:48,598
I want to tell you something.

16
00:01:48,598 --> 00:01:50,098
You're asking me holes in my stomach.

17
00:01:50,098 --> 00:01:53,098
Heidi, Peter will tell you when he has a letter with him.

18
00:01:53,098 --> 00:01:54,098
He knows you're waiting.

19
00:01:54,098 --> 00:01:58,098
Besides, it's impossible that Clara's letter comes so quickly.

20
00:01:58,098 --> 00:02:00,098
Here, Peter, your breakfast.

21
00:02:01,098 --> 00:02:02,098
Thank you.

22
00:02:03,098 --> 00:02:06,098
Heidi, now forget about this letter for one day.

23
00:02:06,098 --> 00:02:09,098
If you sit around here and wait, that's why it doesn't come earlier.

24
00:02:09,098 --> 00:02:10,598
Yes, but it takes so long.

25
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:12,098
Goodbye!

26
00:02:13,098 --> 00:02:15,098
To be continued

27
00:02:19,578 --> 00:02:23,578
What? I'm really allowed to drive, Mr. Secret Wheel?

28
00:02:23,578 --> 00:02:25,578
Yes, and I'm happy about it.

29
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:27,578
I wouldn't have known how to teach you the opposite.

30
00:02:27,578 --> 00:02:29,578
When do I drive?

31
00:02:29,578 --> 00:02:31,578
As fast as possible.

32
00:02:31,578 --> 00:02:34,578
I mean, of course, as soon as a train leaves and as soon as you've packed.

33
00:02:34,578 --> 00:02:36,578
Oh, thank you very, very much, Mr. Secret Wheel.

34
00:02:36,578 --> 00:02:39,578
If you want to thank me, thank Heidi.

35
00:02:39,578 --> 00:02:42,578
She beat me. She spoke like a waterfall.

36
00:02:43,578 --> 00:02:45,578
And Ms. Rottenmeier had to thank you.

37
00:02:45,578 --> 00:02:48,578
She was willing to explain herself to accompany you.

38
00:02:48,784 --> 00:02:51,284
Oh, Mrs. Rottenmeier is driving too?

39
00:02:51,284 --> 00:02:54,784
Yes, of course. I can't let you drive alone.

40
00:02:54,784 --> 00:02:58,784
But I'm betting on it, Mrs. Clara, that you know that I'm against the trip.

41
00:02:58,784 --> 00:03:01,784
Who knows what else is coming our way?

42
00:03:01,784 --> 00:03:06,784
I accompany you because I feel responsible and I hope you behave accordingly.

43
00:03:06,784 --> 00:03:08,784
Yes.

44
00:03:08,784 --> 00:03:11,784
I would like to ask you to show obedience there as well.

45
00:03:11,784 --> 00:03:14,284
Would you excuse me, please? I have to pack.

46
00:03:14,284 --> 00:03:16,784
Of course, Mrs. Rottenmeier.

47
00:03:18,784 --> 00:03:19,125
Thank you very much.

48
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,125
Does that really have to be the case?

49
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,125
Including Mr. Rottenmeier?

50
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:26,125
She always spoils everything.

51
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,125
Oh, Clara.

52
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,125
Now, don't be unfair.

53
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,125
She's strict with you, I know that.

54
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:35,125
But I also know that I can rely on her in any case.

55
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,125
Yes.

56
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,125
She's too careful, of course.

57
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,125
But that's because she's afraid of you.

58
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,125
She doesn't mean it badly.

59
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,125
Believe me, it's the best thing for you, Clara.

60
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:47,125
Possible. I'm already quiet.

61
00:03:47,339 --> 00:03:49,639
Maybe it's a good thing that she's coming with us.

62
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:53,639
Maybe she'll understand why Heidi didn't feel comfortable with us.

63
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,339
You think so?

64
00:03:55,339 --> 00:04:00,339
Just for that reason, it was worth it to send Mrs. Rottenmeier to the mountains.

65
00:04:00,339 --> 00:04:02,839
Maybe she even likes it here.

66
00:04:02,839 --> 00:04:04,839
I'm even sure that she likes it.

67
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:07,339
Even Mrs. Rottenmeier has earned a vacation once.

68
00:04:07,339 --> 00:04:09,339
Will you come visit us, Dad?

69
00:04:09,339 --> 00:04:14,339
Yes, and I'll write to Grandmother if she also wants to come with us.

70
00:04:14,491 --> 00:04:17,491
Let's surprise Heidi with it, okay?

71
00:04:28,491 --> 00:04:29,491
Clara!

72
00:04:30,491 --> 00:04:31,491
Clara!

73
00:04:31,491 --> 00:04:33,491
Yes, what is it?

74
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:36,491
I want to discuss a few things with you.

75
00:04:36,491 --> 00:04:40,491
But first tell me, why are you so happy? You don't even know the mountains.

76
00:04:40,491 --> 00:04:42,491
Of course I'm looking forward to Heidi.

77
00:04:42,763 --> 00:04:48,163
That's what I thought. But I'm not just letting you drive so you can see Heidi.
I want you to know that.

78
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:49,763
Will you promise me something, Clara?

79
00:04:49,763 --> 00:04:50,763
Uh-huh.

80
00:04:50,763 --> 00:04:56,563
It was always very comfortable for you here in Frankfurt. Sebastian is there for
you. And the wheelchair.

81
00:04:56,667 --> 00:05:00,167
You've never had to try running. You've never even wanted to.

82
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:01,667
Of course I've always wanted to.

83
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:02,667
Yes, a little.

84
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:06,467
You can never have really wanted to, Clara, because you've never tried.

85
00:05:06,467 --> 00:05:09,167
And that's exactly what you're supposed to promise me.

86
00:05:09,167 --> 00:05:13,167
I'd like you to try standing on your own two legs.

87
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:16,667
If you really want to, Clara, you'll be able to one day.

88
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:19,667
The next few weeks you'll spend up there in the mountains

89
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:22,167
won't be just a pleasure for you, you know?

90
00:05:22,167 --> 00:05:25,167
You'll only be able to use your wheelchair in the vicinity of the hut,

91
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:27,167
otherwise it would be too dangerous.

92
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,667
I know, yes.

93
00:05:28,667 --> 00:05:30,667
You only believe to know how it is up there.

94
00:05:30,667 --> 00:05:32,667
You only know what Heidi told you.

95
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:33,667
Yes.

96
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:37,667
There are no roads and streets like here in Frankfurt.

97
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:40,167
There are steep slopes and deep sluices.

98
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:42,667
It's very uncomfortable for you up there.

99
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:45,167
Why? Why do they allow it?

100
00:05:45,195 --> 00:05:52,195
Don't worry, I've thought about it very carefully, if it's right to agree, but I
have a hope for this trip.

101
00:05:52,195 --> 00:05:54,195
You believe Clara?

102
00:05:54,195 --> 00:06:02,195
Yes, don't be afraid to say it. I still believe that Clara can walk one day, if
she finally wants to.

103
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:08,195
For the first time in your life, it will be a bit difficult for you, Clara.
Maybe it will help you.

104
00:06:08,195 --> 00:06:10,166
You think I'm just lazy.

105
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:15,166
So similar. Lazy is not the right word. I believe that you just don't trust it.

106
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:19,166
Then they mean it seriously. Is there still hope?

107
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,166
Yes.

108
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:26,166
I've always wanted to. I really can't do it.

109
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:31,166
You see, my child, that's what I meant. Do you understand me now?

110
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:36,166
That's exactly what it is. You admit that you can't do it and that's why you
don't even try.

111
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:40,390
I will try. I promise it to him, for sure.

112
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,390
Good.

113
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:44,990
You couldn't make a greater joy out of your father and me.

114
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:48,190
You know, a promise is a promise.

115
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:53,190
And it's not broken. You two taught me that.

116
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,990
Prove that it's true.

117
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,390
Yes, of course.

118
00:07:02,364 --> 00:07:14,364
MUSIC

119
00:07:14,364 --> 00:07:17,364
Heidi, he's here! He has arrived!

120
00:07:17,364 --> 00:07:19,364
Is he Clara's?

121
00:07:19,364 --> 00:07:22,364
Of course! Who else could it be?

122
00:07:22,364 --> 00:07:24,364
Finally!

123
00:07:24,364 --> 00:07:25,364
All three at once!

124
00:07:25,364 --> 00:07:27,364
All three at once, you're good.

125
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,364
There's only one of them.

126
00:07:29,364 --> 00:07:31,364
That's Clara's.

127
00:07:31,364 --> 00:07:34,364
Give it to me! I'll bring the others to the Alps!

128
00:07:34,364 --> 00:07:36,364
Yes!

129
00:07:38,364 --> 00:07:39,728
Dear Heidi...

130
00:07:39,728 --> 00:07:41,728
I'm so happy the secret guard said I can come.

131
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:43,728
Imagine I can come.

132
00:07:43,728 --> 00:07:44,728
Hooray!

133
00:07:44,728 --> 00:07:47,728
Clara is coming. The secret guard kept his promise.

134
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:49,728
Grandfather, she's coming. We have to prepare everything.

135
00:07:49,728 --> 00:07:51,728
I'm so happy for you, child.

136
00:07:53,728 --> 00:07:54,864
Who screamed at you?

137
00:07:54,864 --> 00:07:56,864
Mr. Sesemann and the secret council.

138
00:07:56,864 --> 00:08:00,864
Listen, Clara writes, she's lucky because she's allowed to come.

139
00:08:00,864 --> 00:08:02,864
But she's also coming?

140
00:08:02,864 --> 00:08:04,864
That can't be true.

141
00:08:04,864 --> 00:08:06,864
Mrs. Rottenmeier is also coming.

142
00:08:06,864 --> 00:08:10,864
Did you think Clara could travel all by herself?

143
00:08:10,864 --> 00:08:12,864
Maybe I misread myself?

144
00:08:12,864 --> 00:08:15,864
How terrible! How horrible!

145
00:08:15,864 --> 00:08:16,864
What?

146
00:08:17,014 --> 00:08:19,014
Unfortunately, I didn't read myself.

147
00:08:19,014 --> 00:08:21,014
We'll be done with you somehow.

148
00:08:21,014 --> 00:08:24,014
With Mr. Rottenmeier, no one gets done so quickly.

149
00:08:25,014 --> 00:08:30,014
But Heidi, you make a face as if a ghost had just passed you by.

150
00:08:30,014 --> 00:08:32,014
You have no idea.

151
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,014
Clara, Clara, Clara!

152
00:08:37,424 --> 00:08:40,024
Yeah, well, I'm glad she's finally coming.

153
00:08:40,024 --> 00:08:43,124
Well, if you think so, but is that all that's in the letter?

154
00:08:43,124 --> 00:08:45,124
Isn't there something for me in there too?

155
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:47,124
Why, for you?

156
00:08:47,124 --> 00:08:50,124
Dossi writes something, nice greetings to Peter.

157
00:08:52,124 --> 00:08:53,124
No more?

158
00:08:57,124 --> 00:08:58,961
Did you thank him too?

159
00:08:58,961 --> 00:09:00,961
But it's weird.

160
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:04,961
Why didn't she write anything about new sausages if you said how good they
tasted?

161
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,961
Or is there something in there?

162
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:08,961
No, she doesn't write anything about sausages.

163
00:09:08,961 --> 00:09:10,961
Ed!

164
00:09:10,961 --> 00:09:12,961
Too bad.

165
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:14,961
You're an old fart.

166
00:09:14,961 --> 00:09:16,961
Can you always think about food?

167
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:22,961
Can you do me a favor?

168
00:09:22,961 --> 00:09:24,961
But of course.

169
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:25,873
Good.

170
00:09:25,873 --> 00:09:28,473
Heidi and I want to go down to Dörfli.

171
00:09:28,673 --> 00:09:31,473
Will you lock the goats in the stable tonight?

172
00:09:31,673 --> 00:09:33,073
I'd love to.

173
00:09:37,273 --> 00:09:41,473
Clara will see the moon and the stars for the first time.

174
00:09:41,673 --> 00:09:44,273
Heidi, let's go to Dörfli.

175
00:09:44,473 --> 00:09:46,073
Why?

176
00:09:46,273 --> 00:09:49,273
I want to see if I can build a house

177
00:09:49,473 --> 00:09:51,873
where we lived last winter.

178
00:09:52,241 --> 00:09:54,241
Why don't we live here?

179
00:09:54,241 --> 00:09:56,241
Why don't we all live here together?

180
00:09:56,241 --> 00:09:58,241
You know Mrs. Rottenmeier will come with us.

181
00:09:58,241 --> 00:10:00,241
Wonderful! She can stay alone in the village.

182
00:10:00,241 --> 00:10:02,241
But she won't want that.

183
00:10:02,241 --> 00:10:04,241
How do you want to do your work there?

184
00:10:04,241 --> 00:10:06,241
I come here every day.

185
00:10:06,241 --> 00:10:08,241
That's way too hard.

186
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:10,241
But Heidi, it doesn't matter to me.

187
00:10:10,241 --> 00:10:12,241
You will help me somehow.

188
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:20,241
Grandmother!

189
00:10:20,241 --> 00:10:20,971
It's him!

190
00:10:20,971 --> 00:10:21,971
Finally, so far!

191
00:10:21,971 --> 00:10:22,971
So?

192
00:10:22,971 --> 00:10:23,971
Yes, what?

193
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:25,971
I have wonderful new news for us.

194
00:10:25,971 --> 00:10:28,971
And what are these wonderful new news for us?

195
00:10:28,971 --> 00:10:30,971
You can guess three times.

196
00:10:30,971 --> 00:10:32,971
What can that be?

197
00:10:32,971 --> 00:10:35,971
Just let me think.

198
00:10:35,971 --> 00:10:39,971
Since there are so good news, it can only be one thing you mean.

199
00:10:39,971 --> 00:10:42,971
Your friend Clara from Frankfurt is coming to visit us.

200
00:10:42,971 --> 00:10:45,971
Yes, imagine Clara is coming.

201
00:10:45,971 --> 00:10:48,971
Are you looking forward to it?

202
00:10:48,971 --> 00:10:49,547
Yes.

203
00:10:49,547 --> 00:10:52,547
Oh, yes. Aren't you happy at all?

204
00:10:52,547 --> 00:10:55,547
Yes, yes. But I'm afraid.

205
00:10:55,547 --> 00:11:02,547
You know, Heidi, I'm afraid that these strangers from Frankfurt will think of
taking you away from us again.

206
00:11:02,547 --> 00:11:06,547
You don't seriously think that someone will manage to get me out of here again?

207
00:11:06,547 --> 00:11:09,547
Oh, if that were true, Heidi.

208
00:11:09,547 --> 00:11:10,401
Certainly.

209
00:11:10,401 --> 00:11:15,601
I'm never leaving, but you know what? I'm going to bring Clara. She can read you
something.

210
00:11:15,601 --> 00:11:18,801
That's good. Can she read as beautifully as you?

211
00:11:18,801 --> 00:11:22,101
Clara can read a thousand times better than I can.

212
00:11:22,101 --> 00:11:25,101
Have fun with your friend, Heidi.

213
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:28,601
Goodbye! I'll be back as soon as I can!

214
00:11:33,451 --> 00:11:39,451
Do you remember? In this abandoned house the Almöhi and Heidi spent the last
winter.

215
00:11:39,451 --> 00:11:44,451
Here they lived for many months with their goats while it was snowing outside
and cold.

216
00:11:44,451 --> 00:11:50,451
Heidi loved this house and she wanted it to look as beautiful as possible for
Clara.

217
00:11:50,451 --> 00:11:56,451
Every day she climbed up to the hut with her grandfather to do the daily work.

218
00:11:56,451 --> 00:12:01,451
And although she was sometimes very tired, she never sat still.

219
00:12:01,484 --> 00:12:08,484
Every day she asked Peter for a letter from Clara, because she knew that Clara
and Mrs. Rottenmeier were already very close.

220
00:12:08,484 --> 00:12:12,484
Clara was supposed to get used to the new climate in a spa.

221
00:12:12,484 --> 00:12:16,484
And then the letter came. Peter brought it to her.

222
00:12:16,484 --> 00:12:18,484
Tomorrow they will finally come.

223
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:36,484
To be continued ...

224
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,710
Oh boy, there's a car coming!

225
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,346
Hey, look over there!

226
00:12:45,346 --> 00:12:47,346
There's a car coming!

227
00:12:47,346 --> 00:12:49,346
Yes!

228
00:12:49,346 --> 00:12:51,346
Yes!

229
00:12:51,346 --> 00:12:53,346
Yes!

230
00:12:53,346 --> 00:12:55,346
Yes!

231
00:12:55,346 --> 00:12:57,346
Grandfather, I think they're coming!

232
00:12:57,346 --> 00:12:59,346
Quick, come with me outside!

233
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:01,346
I'll run towards them! Hurry up, Grandfather!

234
00:13:01,346 --> 00:13:03,346
Oh, there you are!

235
00:13:03,346 --> 00:13:05,346
Clara!

236
00:13:05,346 --> 00:13:07,346
Clara!

237
00:13:09,346 --> 00:13:11,346
Who's in there?

238
00:13:11,346 --> 00:13:13,346
Come on!

239
00:13:13,346 --> 00:13:15,346
We'll be right there!

240
00:13:15,346 --> 00:13:17,346
Go back through the window!

241
00:13:17,346 --> 00:13:19,346
Otherwise they'll catch us!

242
00:13:19,346 --> 00:13:21,346
Yes!

243
00:13:21,346 --> 00:13:23,346
Yes!

244
00:13:23,346 --> 00:13:25,346
I can hear them!

245
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,346
Clara!

246
00:13:27,346 --> 00:13:29,346
Clara!

247
00:13:29,346 --> 00:13:31,346
Isn't that Heidi's voice?

248
00:13:31,346 --> 00:13:33,346
Heidi!

249
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:35,346
Stop!

250
00:13:35,346 --> 00:13:37,346
Heidi!

251
00:13:37,346 --> 00:13:39,346
What did you say?

252
00:13:39,346 --> 00:13:41,346
Clara!

253
00:13:41,346 --> 00:13:43,346
Finally!

254
00:13:43,366 --> 00:13:46,366
Did you have as much fun as I did today?

255
00:13:46,366 --> 00:13:48,366
You don't know how much I waited.

256
00:13:48,366 --> 00:13:49,366
It took so long.

257
00:13:49,366 --> 00:13:50,366
Come in.

258
00:13:50,366 --> 00:13:51,366
Sebastian!

259
00:13:51,366 --> 00:13:53,366
Have a nice day, Miss.

260
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:55,366
I don't think I heard you right.

261
00:13:55,366 --> 00:13:56,366
He said Miss.

262
00:13:57,366 --> 00:14:00,366
Come into the carriage and show us how to drive.

263
00:14:00,366 --> 00:14:01,366
Of course.

264
00:14:02,366 --> 00:14:04,366
I greet you, nobility.

265
00:14:04,366 --> 00:14:05,366
Thank you.

266
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:07,366
Good day, Miss Rottenmeier.

267
00:14:09,158 --> 00:14:11,158
Something like that is ridiculous.

268
00:14:11,158 --> 00:14:14,158
It's not ridiculous at all. That's what they do in the city.

269
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:20,158
I'm so happy.

270
00:14:20,158 --> 00:14:21,158
Me too.

271
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,958
Look at this!

272
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,958
We're here! Grandfather!

273
00:14:50,465 --> 00:14:54,465
You can get out. We're here, Miss Rottenmeier.

274
00:14:57,465 --> 00:15:00,465
Is there a house outside the ruin?

275
00:15:00,465 --> 00:15:05,465
Sorry, there are only apple trees and what you call a ruin.

276
00:15:05,465 --> 00:15:07,465
I don't like jokes.

277
00:15:07,465 --> 00:15:09,465
I don't dare to joke.

278
00:15:09,465 --> 00:15:12,465
You have to tell us if Heidi lives here.

279
00:15:12,465 --> 00:15:13,465
If we want.

280
00:15:13,465 --> 00:15:15,465
This is the winter house.

281
00:15:15,719 --> 00:15:16,719
Winter house?

282
00:15:16,719 --> 00:15:18,719
Yes, they only live here in winter.

283
00:15:18,719 --> 00:15:20,719
Hopefully I was just dreaming.

284
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:24,719
Sebastian! Why isn't anyone helping me get out of the carriage?

285
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:26,719
Excuse me, I'm coming.

286
00:15:37,441 --> 00:15:39,441
Not even curtains yet.

287
00:15:39,441 --> 00:15:41,441
Clara, this is the grandfather.

288
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:44,441
Grandfather, and this is Clara.

289
00:15:44,441 --> 00:15:46,441
Heidi told me a lot about you.

290
00:15:46,441 --> 00:15:47,441
Nice that you came.

291
00:15:47,441 --> 00:15:49,441
I'm so happy about it.

292
00:15:49,441 --> 00:15:51,441
I don't even know what to say.

293
00:15:51,441 --> 00:15:53,441
Thank you very much for letting me come here.

294
00:15:53,441 --> 00:15:54,441
You're welcome.

295
00:15:54,441 --> 00:15:56,441
I hope with all my heart that you will like it here with us.

296
00:15:56,441 --> 00:15:58,441
We've been waiting for you for a long time.

297
00:15:58,441 --> 00:16:00,441
I'm sure I'll like it.

298
00:16:00,441 --> 00:16:02,441
Have a nice day.

299
00:16:02,441 --> 00:16:04,441
My name is Rottenmeier.

300
00:16:04,503 --> 00:16:09,003
Aha, Mrs. Rottenmeier. Welcome. I hope you'll enjoy your holidays, too.

301
00:16:09,003 --> 00:16:11,003
What will happen in the next few days?

302
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:13,003
Do you want me to show you the house?

303
00:16:13,003 --> 00:16:14,503
Of course I want to!

304
00:16:14,503 --> 00:16:17,503
Let's go! You've always said that in Frankfurt.

305
00:16:17,503 --> 00:16:19,003
What kind of trees are these?

306
00:16:19,003 --> 00:16:20,503
Apple trees. What else?

307
00:16:20,503 --> 00:16:24,503
You'll have to see them in spring. When they bloom, everything is white and pink
here.

308
00:16:28,503 --> 00:16:33,503
Tell them you were scared when I came here for the first time and saw the house,
too.

309
00:16:33,503 --> 00:16:34,487
No.

310
00:16:34,487 --> 00:16:36,487
It's just...

311
00:16:38,987 --> 00:16:39,987
This is the stable.

312
00:16:39,987 --> 00:16:41,987
Is Geißlein in there? Can I see him?

313
00:16:41,987 --> 00:16:44,487
Not today. The goats are all up on the hill.

314
00:16:44,487 --> 00:16:46,487
That's a shame. Can I see them tomorrow?

315
00:16:46,487 --> 00:16:47,987
Yes, I think so.

316
00:16:47,987 --> 00:16:49,487
Why don't you know exactly?

317
00:16:49,487 --> 00:16:53,987
Because they stay at our hut all summer. We only bring them here in winter.

318
00:16:54,987 --> 00:16:56,487
And where is Josef?

319
00:16:56,487 --> 00:16:57,987
Up there, too.

320
00:16:58,487 --> 00:17:02,487
Oh, then I can't see anyone. And now just say Peter isn't here either.

321
00:17:02,487 --> 00:17:06,487
Of course he isn't here either, but he'll be here tonight for sure.

322
00:17:06,487 --> 00:17:07,487
That's nice.

323
00:17:07,487 --> 00:17:10,487
Come on, Clara, I'll show you what it looks like from the inside.

324
00:17:13,487 --> 00:17:14,487
This is our...

325
00:17:14,593 --> 00:17:17,593
You can't see that in the house from the outside.

326
00:17:17,593 --> 00:17:20,593
Oh, huge.

327
00:17:20,593 --> 00:17:22,593
The oven is beautiful.

328
00:17:22,593 --> 00:17:25,593
I really like it in here.

329
00:17:25,593 --> 00:17:27,593
Much better than from the outside.

330
00:17:27,593 --> 00:17:28,593
I already thought that.

331
00:17:28,593 --> 00:17:31,593
Tell me, what is that over there for a strange box?

332
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:34,593
This is not a strange box, this is my bed, where I sleep.

333
00:17:34,593 --> 00:17:36,593
And that's your bed?

334
00:17:36,593 --> 00:17:39,593
Yes, but I didn't take it away from you, it's not yours otherwise.

335
00:17:39,593 --> 00:17:40,519
No.

336
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:42,519
I always sleep in that box.

337
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:45,019
The grandfather made the bed for you.

338
00:17:45,019 --> 00:17:47,019
He did that for me?

339
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,940
Oh, I can only hope that this is the goat stable and not the guest house.

340
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,940
It goes along here.

341
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,940
Alm Oehi, one moment.

342
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:19,940
Excuse me for asking, but isn't there a guest house in the village?

343
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,940
Coincidentally, no.

344
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,940
Are there at least servants?

345
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,940
I mean clean and willing people who can do something for me.

346
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,930
I don't care if it's male or female.

347
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:38,430
The people here in the mountains work hard from early to late to earn a living.

348
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,130
I don't think I'll find anyone.

349
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,630
But I'm ready to pay particularly well for it.

350
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:46,030
How generous. Offer it. Maybe someone will come.

351
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:50,230
I didn't want to hurt you, but someone has to prepare the meals for us.

352
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:53,430
I'll do that, as always. And Heidi will help me with that.

353
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:02,130
Mrs. Rottenmeier, the more you get used to doing one or the other yourself, the
better.

354
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:05,130
Do you work for all the time, Sebastian?

355
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,130
Unfortunately, no.

356
00:19:17,052 --> 00:19:20,052
Over there you can see the mountains best.

357
00:19:20,052 --> 00:19:23,052
Have you ever lived in a house without a roof, Sebastian?

358
00:19:23,052 --> 00:19:24,052
No.

359
00:19:24,052 --> 00:19:26,052
I still can't believe it all.

360
00:19:26,052 --> 00:19:28,052
Our grandfather and I live up there.

361
00:19:28,052 --> 00:19:31,052
There is our hut and there are also our goats.

362
00:19:31,052 --> 00:19:33,052
All the way up there on the top of the mountain?

363
00:19:33,052 --> 00:19:37,052
Oh, what? Not all the way up, about half up.

364
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:39,052
Does Peter live that far up too?

365
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:41,052
Not quite that far.

366
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:44,670
Sebastian, let's go up right away. I want to look at it.

367
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:47,170
Please say yes. The sun goes down up there.

368
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,170
That's good here too.

369
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:59,170
Grandfather, Clara wants us to go up to the hut today.

370
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:03,324
What do you mean? That's not a question at all.

371
00:20:03,324 --> 00:20:06,324
What's the point of this nonsense, Mrs. Clara? It gets dark at any moment.

372
00:20:06,324 --> 00:20:07,324
That's far too dangerous.

373
00:20:07,324 --> 00:20:09,324
No, we want to spend the night in Heidi's hut.

374
00:20:09,324 --> 00:20:13,324
It's not dangerous. We just want to look at the stars through the roof.

375
00:20:13,324 --> 00:20:15,324
Adelheid, please don't get involved in this.

376
00:20:15,324 --> 00:20:20,324
I won't allow you to stomp around in the mountains with them in the middle of
the night.

377
00:20:20,324 --> 00:20:22,324
Mrs. Rottenmeier.

378
00:20:22,324 --> 00:20:25,324
Clara, we'll get up early in the morning to the hut.

379
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:28,324
The mountains are much nicer in the morning.

380
00:20:28,482 --> 00:20:30,982
You'll be able to see the stars from up close, too.

381
00:20:30,982 --> 00:20:33,982
But you won't be able to see anything from the mountains when it gets dark.

382
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,782
Yes, that's good. I'll wait until tomorrow.

383
00:20:36,782 --> 00:20:39,982
We can go up there with the goats tomorrow morning.

384
00:20:39,982 --> 00:20:41,982
I'm going to take care of dinner now.

385
00:20:41,982 --> 00:20:46,482
It's not all that much I can do, but I do hope that everyone will like it.

386
00:20:46,482 --> 00:20:49,782
Heidi, please be so kind as to show Mrs. Rottenmeier her room.

387
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:51,782
Yes, all right. Come on, Mrs. Rottenmeier.

388
00:20:51,782 --> 00:20:54,782
There's nothing else left for me.

389
00:20:54,782 --> 00:20:58,282
Grandfather can cook well. Hopefully you're hungry.

390
00:20:58,282 --> 00:20:59,287
Yes, of course.

391
00:20:59,287 --> 00:21:02,287
Man, what is it? Did you hurt yourself?

392
00:21:02,287 --> 00:21:06,287
There's a bear out there. I knew there was something like this here.

393
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:13,599
Here I am!

394
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,599
Why don't you come in?

395
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:18,099
What was that?

396
00:21:18,099 --> 00:21:19,599
Don't stand there like that!

397
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:21,099
Why did they scream like that?

398
00:21:21,099 --> 00:21:22,099
Don't be a coward, Peter!

399
00:21:22,099 --> 00:21:23,099
I don't want to come in!

400
00:21:23,099 --> 00:21:24,099
Leave me alone!

401
00:21:24,099 --> 00:21:25,099
That's Clara!

402
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:28,099
Hello, how are you, Peter?

403
00:21:28,099 --> 00:21:29,099
I don't know.

404
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:34,269
Clara?

405
00:21:34,269 --> 00:21:37,069
Peter wants to know if you brought him sausages.

406
00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:38,269
That's not true at all.

407
00:21:38,269 --> 00:21:39,269
I did.

408
00:21:39,269 --> 00:21:40,269
What a shame.

409
00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:41,269
Well, Peter.

410
00:21:41,269 --> 00:21:42,269
Don't believe him, Clara.

411
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:43,269
Now he's ashamed, of course.

412
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:45,269
But Peter can eat all day.

413
00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:46,269
That's not true.

414
00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:47,269
That's not true.

415
00:21:49,269 --> 00:21:52,269
Well, how good that I thought about it and brought some.

416
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,269
Thank you.

417
00:21:53,269 --> 00:21:54,269
Well, you see, Peter.

418
00:21:54,269 --> 00:21:55,269
Stop it, Heidi.

419
00:21:55,269 --> 00:21:57,269
What should she think of me?

420
00:22:04,269 --> 00:22:05,269
Ah!

421
00:22:05,269 --> 00:22:06,269
Ah!

422
00:22:06,269 --> 00:22:07,269
Ah!

423
00:22:07,269 --> 00:22:08,269
Ah!

424
00:22:08,663 --> 00:22:11,163
Oh, no, no!

425
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,663
I've never tasted anything as good as today!

426
00:22:14,663 --> 00:22:18,663
Good night, Peter! Get us off with the goats tomorrow, but don't oversleep!

427
00:22:18,663 --> 00:22:20,663
Good night, Heidi!

428
00:22:20,663 --> 00:22:22,663
Sleep well! See you tomorrow!

429
00:22:25,663 --> 00:22:29,163
Come on, it's time to go in. You'll get cold otherwise.

430
00:22:29,163 --> 00:22:30,663
Good, let's go to sleep.

431
00:22:30,663 --> 00:22:31,663
Good!

432
00:22:36,087 --> 00:22:45,087
The next morning, the two children got up very early and for the first time
Clara could see the hut that Heidi had told her so much about in Frankfurt.

433
00:22:45,087 --> 00:22:49,087
She got to know Bärli and Schwänli and the many little funny chicks.

434
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:56,001
She was afraid of the big fat Joseph at first, but Peter and Heidi helped her
overcome the fear quickly.

435
00:22:56,001 --> 00:23:00,601
Clara's first day up in the mountains was like a dream for her.

436
00:23:00,601 --> 00:23:03,901
She wished that all of this would never stop.

437
00:23:03,901 --> 00:23:07,601
Peter had even come up with something very special to welcome her.

438
00:23:07,601 --> 00:23:14,201
But we want to tell you about it and whether it was really something special in
our next story.

439
00:23:14,201 --> 00:23:22,201
Heidi, Heidi, your world are the mountains.

440
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:30,201
Heidi, Heidi, because up here you are at home.

441
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:43,201
Heidi, Heidi, come home, find your happiness, come back home.

442
00:23:44,201 --> 00:23:45,880
Bärli and Schwänli
