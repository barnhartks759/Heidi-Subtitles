1
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:30,346
Autumn was nearing its end. Winter stood in front of the door. When Heidi went
to the fountain in the morning to wash herself, it was mostly bitter cold

2
00:01:30,346 --> 00:01:31,346
Cold

3
00:01:31,346 --> 00:01:33,346
Rub well, that's healthy

4
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:40,210
I can't help myself. I think the summer is better.

5
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,210
You won't be blown away.

6
00:02:00,058 --> 00:02:03,358
It was so cold this morning, too. I almost got blown away.

7
00:02:03,358 --> 00:02:03,958
How?

8
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,958
My nose is almost gone.

9
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:09,758
I think I'm blue everywhere.

10
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,758
And I'm rumbling. That's healthy.

11
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,258
Who says that?

12
00:02:15,858 --> 00:02:17,858
Since when is freezing healthy?

13
00:02:18,358 --> 00:02:19,358
Since today.

14
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,058
Snowflakes.

15
00:02:23,058 --> 00:02:25,258
The first snow. It's snowing.

16
00:02:25,258 --> 00:02:27,258
It's snowing, it's snowing, it's snowing.

17
00:02:27,258 --> 00:02:29,258
I missed that, fortunately.

18
00:02:29,936 --> 00:02:32,936
- Heidi? - Grandfather, come outside!

19
00:02:32,936 --> 00:02:38,936
- Come with me, it started snowing! - Shit, I missed a starfish and not just
snow.

20
00:02:39,936 --> 00:02:43,936
Look at that, white, fat flocks.

21
00:02:43,936 --> 00:02:46,936
- So our winter begins. - Peter!

22
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,690
Soft white snowflakes!

23
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,690
They look like little white cotton stars.

24
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,690
It's snowing! It's snowing! It's snowing!

25
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:06,989
It's snowing! Even the window is snowed!

26
00:04:26,549 --> 00:04:28,549
Minnie! Has something happened?

27
00:04:29,549 --> 00:04:31,549
Yes, of course something has happened!

28
00:04:31,549 --> 00:04:33,549
Haven't you seen that there is snow everywhere?

29
00:04:33,549 --> 00:04:36,549
Everything is white, as white as a new bedcloth!

30
00:04:36,549 --> 00:04:38,549
Even on my bed there is snow!

31
00:04:38,549 --> 00:04:42,549
It has snowed. I will cover the hatch somehow.

32
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:46,549
But why? It is nice to sleep in a bed made of snow.

33
00:04:58,933 --> 00:05:00,933
Even on top of the trees.

34
00:05:43,573 --> 00:05:46,573
Come back to the house, Heidi. You're going to catch a cold.

35
00:05:46,573 --> 00:05:49,573
Do the tree hats have snow so they don't freeze?

36
00:05:50,573 --> 00:05:53,573
You should put on a hat too.

37
00:05:53,573 --> 00:05:56,573
The trees are rustling.

38
00:05:57,573 --> 00:05:59,573
The trees don't talk, I know that.

39
00:05:59,573 --> 00:06:02,573
And yet I think sometimes they want to tell me something.

40
00:06:02,573 --> 00:06:05,573
Do you think you can understand what they say, grandfather?

41
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,573
I can try.

42
00:06:07,573 --> 00:06:09,573
But listen carefully.

43
00:06:20,016 --> 00:06:26,016
No, I don't hear anything. But maybe I'm too old to hear trees talking.

44
00:06:28,016 --> 00:06:32,016
What? Too old? Do you hear anything? I didn't even notice that.

45
00:06:33,016 --> 00:06:35,016
I still have as good ears as a rabbit.

46
00:06:35,016 --> 00:06:37,016
But they're not that long.

47
00:06:38,016 --> 00:06:41,016
Come with me, Joseph. I'll show you something. Come.

48
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
How can you get out, Joseph?

49
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,320
Did you scare me, Joseph?

50
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,320
At least you're awake now!

51
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:52,336
Heidi, come into the hut now. The snow is too wet.

52
00:07:54,136 --> 00:07:57,336
I'm not cold at all and the snow is not wet either.

53
00:07:57,536 --> 00:07:59,136
Come in now anyway.

54
00:07:59,736 --> 00:08:02,536
Oh no, why?

55
00:08:04,536 --> 00:08:07,536
Peter hasn't come with his goat herder today.

56
00:08:07,736 --> 00:08:10,936
He won't come. When it snows, the goats have to stay down.

57
00:08:11,136 --> 00:08:13,736
They'll only come up to us again next spring.

58
00:08:13,936 --> 00:08:17,536
You mean Peter won't come and visit us for the whole winter?

59
00:08:17,536 --> 00:08:19,536
He'll stay down in the valley?

60
00:09:00,971 --> 00:09:04,971
Grandfather, come quickly, it's over there.

61
00:09:04,971 --> 00:09:06,971
Where is something? Show me.

62
00:09:06,971 --> 00:09:09,971
Come here to me, then you can see it better.

63
00:09:09,971 --> 00:09:11,971
Good.

64
00:09:25,355 --> 00:09:29,355
It's a deer. He'll be looking for something edible.

65
00:09:29,355 --> 00:09:32,355
Why don't we feed him when he's hungry?

66
00:09:32,355 --> 00:09:37,355
It doesn't make any sense at the moment. These wild animals are very shy and run
away immediately when you approach them.

67
00:09:37,355 --> 00:09:41,355
We're going to lay hay for him tonight. He can pick it up tomorrow morning.

68
00:09:41,355 --> 00:09:48,355
The snow can't even get close to him. He stands under the tree like under a
roof. The branches protect him.

69
00:09:51,355 --> 00:09:53,355
Shouldn't I get him some hay?

70
00:09:53,355 --> 00:09:54,355
No, only later.

71
00:09:55,025 --> 00:09:57,425
But I think he's taking it from me.

72
00:09:57,425 --> 00:09:58,425
You think?

73
00:09:58,425 --> 00:10:01,425
Well, if you're so sure about that, give it a try.

74
00:10:12,715 --> 00:10:14,715
No, I have something to eat for you.

75
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:18,715
You don't have to be afraid, I won't do anything to you.

76
00:10:29,227 --> 00:10:31,227
So he ran away after all.

77
00:10:31,227 --> 00:10:33,227
Yes, that's him.

78
00:10:33,227 --> 00:10:37,227
I wouldn't have done anything to him.

79
00:10:37,227 --> 00:10:41,227
Heidi, when will you finally learn to have a little more patience?

80
00:10:41,227 --> 00:10:45,227
Especially in dealing with animals, you need a lot of patience.

81
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,227
Put your hay where the deer was standing,

82
00:10:47,227 --> 00:10:49,227
back there under the tree, and then wait.

83
00:10:49,227 --> 00:10:51,227
Yes, I'll do that.

84
00:10:51,227 --> 00:10:53,227
It's still a little dry there.

85
00:10:55,227 --> 00:10:57,227
There he is.

86
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:00,257
Enjoy your meal.

87
00:11:01,257 --> 00:11:02,257
Come on.

88
00:11:03,257 --> 00:11:05,257
He hid behind another tree.

89
00:11:05,257 --> 00:11:07,257
Now I'm curious.

90
00:11:26,571 --> 00:11:31,571
It tastes good. And he didn't wait as long as I thought.

91
00:11:37,771 --> 00:11:46,771
It snowed for many days. The sky was covered with thick snow clouds and you
could hardly see the roof a few steps away from the hut.

92
00:11:47,771 --> 00:11:51,771
Heidi didn't mind. She had discovered a new occupation.

93
00:11:55,771 --> 00:12:03,740
Every day she went to the big tall tree she always thought he would talk to her
and planted hay and grains for the animals in the forest.

94
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:08,740
For Heidi, the snow-capped mountains had their own special magic.

95
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:08,230
That's what you get for the others!

96
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,690
He ate my hand off!

97
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,650
I held his bowl, and he ate it all at once!

98
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,110
You've been patient.

99
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,710
I've got a new friend!

100
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,750
That's beautiful.

101
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,670
I've got a fre*

102
00:13:44,294 --> 00:13:47,294
Grandfather, can you make it a little bit more similar? Can you make it a little
bit more similar?

103
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:49,294
Give it to me, I can try. Give it to me, I can try.

104
00:13:55,782 --> 00:13:57,782
The main thing is that he gets an earring.

105
00:13:57,782 --> 00:13:59,782
A head and four legs.

106
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:11,550
Looks more like a goat's butt.

107
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,550
Is it very heavy?

108
00:14:27,974 --> 00:14:29,974
Because you like animals so much.

109
00:14:29,974 --> 00:14:31,974
Oh, thank you.

110
00:14:31,974 --> 00:14:32,974
Thank you!

111
00:14:32,974 --> 00:14:34,974
This is the most beautiful day of my life!

112
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:36,974
I got a wood animal!

113
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:58,494
Don't you like your wood animal anymore?

114
00:15:00,494 --> 00:15:06,494
Yes, but your Steinbock reminded me of the goat herd, and Schnucki, and Peter.

115
00:15:37,825 --> 00:15:41,825
If only it was spring again, so I could see them all again.

116
00:15:42,825 --> 00:15:46,825
The winter in the mountains is very lonely, my child. I know that well.

117
00:15:48,825 --> 00:15:52,825
No, I'm not lonely. You and Joseph, you're here.

118
00:15:53,825 --> 00:15:55,825
And my animals out in the forest.

119
00:16:09,153 --> 00:16:13,153
So either the wind rolled at the door or there is someone out there.

120
00:16:13,153 --> 00:16:16,153
At least it knocked very clearly at the door.

121
00:16:21,953 --> 00:16:26,953
Maybe your deer will come to visit you, or the snowman you built yesterday
outside.

122
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:28,953
There, again.

123
00:16:28,953 --> 00:16:30,953
Do you hear?

124
00:16:30,953 --> 00:16:34,953
So I didn't get confused. There's actually someone in front of the door.

125
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:39,953
That can only be your snowman. Who should visit us up here in the middle of
winter?

126
00:16:39,953 --> 00:16:42,953
In the hut he immediately smiles, the poor snowman.

127
00:16:57,857 --> 00:17:01,857
Before I send him out, you should look at him first.

128
00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:13,689
Oh, you're frozen stiff.

129
00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:16,689
Come, sit down on the fire, Peter, to get up.

130
00:17:21,025 --> 00:17:24,025
And slowly your nose will get a normal color again.

131
00:17:26,525 --> 00:17:29,025
Since I know you, Peter, I know what you think.

132
00:17:34,433 --> 00:17:37,433
What are you two still waiting for? Get started.

133
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:38,433
I'd love to.

134
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,433
The milk is hot, that's good.

135
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:50,033
Cheese tastes best with olive oil.

136
00:17:56,577 --> 00:18:00,577
You can't go out with the goats any more. What are you doing all day?

137
00:18:06,577 --> 00:18:10,577
If Peter has something to eat, you can't expect an answer from him.

138
00:18:10,577 --> 00:18:12,577
Then you tell me.

139
00:18:12,577 --> 00:18:15,577
You could come on your own. We're going to school.

140
00:18:15,577 --> 00:18:19,577
Voluntarily? I didn't know you liked going to school.

141
00:18:19,577 --> 00:18:26,418
Now you've swallowed yourself too.

142
00:18:26,418 --> 00:18:28,418
Do you have to scare me like that?

143
00:18:28,418 --> 00:18:31,418
Tell me, how is it at school? What does it look like?

144
00:18:33,418 --> 00:18:35,418
The school looks like a house.

145
00:18:35,418 --> 00:18:38,418
I see. And what do the people look like when they go to school?

146
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:41,418
Wait a minute. Let me think.

147
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:48,418
Well, they look...

148
00:18:49,418 --> 00:18:52,418
Somehow, you know, they look like people.

149
00:18:52,914 --> 00:18:59,914
Peter could not start too much with the school, he found it terribly boring and
he hardly gave himself the trouble to hide it.

150
00:19:03,914 --> 00:19:11,914
Strangely, in the meadows in the summer, when he was out with his goats, he
always knew how to do the right thing, but here at school everything went wrong
with him.

151
00:19:20,732 --> 00:19:23,732
If it doesn't want to go into the head, it has to go on it.

152
00:19:33,052 --> 00:19:37,052
Heidi would certainly talk more there than all the teachers of the school
together.

153
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:40,052
I think it's very funny to go to school.

154
00:19:40,052 --> 00:19:42,052
If only it were funny.

155
00:19:42,052 --> 00:19:46,052
It's nice with you, up here in the hut, I like it there.

156
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:48,052
That makes me happy, Peter.

157
00:19:48,052 --> 00:19:51,052
Did you get enough to eat with us?

158
00:19:51,052 --> 00:19:54,052
No, I can always eat more, that's just the way it is.

159
00:19:54,052 --> 00:19:57,052
I believe you, Peter, you'll never say that in your life.

160
00:19:57,052 --> 00:19:59,052
What can I do about it?

161
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,940
Goodbye, Peter. That was a big surprise for me.

162
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,940
If you want, I can come back next Sunday.

163
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,940
On Sundays we're free from school.

164
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,940
Oh, please, yes. He wants to come back.

165
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,940
I'm looking forward to you, Peter.

166
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,940
I'll come for sure.

167
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,940
Nice.

168
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,940
Take care.

169
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:38,444
That was a beautiful day.

170
00:20:38,444 --> 00:20:39,044
Heidi!

171
00:20:43,292 --> 00:20:47,792
I almost forgot. My grandmother invited you to come to us once.

172
00:20:47,792 --> 00:20:49,792
Me?

173
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:52,792
Yes, of course, you. Who else? Can you come?

174
00:20:54,792 --> 00:20:58,792
Heidi didn't know what to say. She had never been invited.

175
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:05,792
Until now, she had never come up with the idea that anyone in the world, except
grandfather of course, would like to have her with them.

176
00:21:05,792 --> 00:21:09,292
What's wrong with you? Have you lost your language?

177
00:21:09,292 --> 00:21:11,792
Do you really mean that?

178
00:21:11,805 --> 00:21:15,305
Or do you say "when I arrive at your place, April, April"?

179
00:21:17,305 --> 00:21:19,305
Do you really mean it?

180
00:21:22,805 --> 00:21:24,805
Can I say that you're coming?

181
00:21:24,805 --> 00:21:26,305
But of course!

182
00:21:26,305 --> 00:21:28,305
Good, then I'll pick you up!

183
00:21:30,805 --> 00:21:32,805
That's your day today!

184
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:44,367
I wasn't invited. I'm allowed to visit someone.

185
00:21:44,367 --> 00:21:46,367
Maybe there's even a homemade cake.

186
00:21:50,367 --> 00:21:52,367
You haven't said anything yet?

187
00:21:55,367 --> 00:21:57,367
Aren't you happy with me at all?

188
00:21:59,367 --> 00:22:01,367
Can't I go, Grandfather?

189
00:22:04,367 --> 00:22:07,367
Why don't you answer, Grandfather?

190
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,181
I thought about it.

191
00:22:09,181 --> 00:22:13,181
I don't think I'll let you go alone with Peter. I'll take you with me.

192
00:22:13,181 --> 00:22:15,181
Can I go? You don't say no.

193
00:22:15,181 --> 00:22:18,181
Hooray! Hooray!

194
00:22:20,181 --> 00:22:23,181
I hope it stops snowing soon.

195
00:22:23,181 --> 00:22:26,181
The Alp Oehi couldn't share Heidi's joy.

196
00:22:26,181 --> 00:22:33,181
He knew Peter's grandmother and he raised the same old roll against her as
against all the inhabitants of Dörfli.

197
00:22:33,181 --> 00:22:38,181
Heidi knew nothing of all this. She just waited for it to finally stop snowing.

198
00:22:50,743 --> 00:22:59,743
But it snowed and snowed for many days and many nights. Heidi became more and
more impatient, but then, one day, it was finally time.

199
00:22:59,743 --> 00:23:10,743
When Heidi got up in the morning, it had stopped snowing. The heavy snow clouds
had disappeared, the sky was as blue as Heidi knew it from the summer, and the
sun was shining on the ice.

200
00:23:10,743 --> 00:23:17,725
Heidi was finally able to paddle into the valley with her grandfather on the
sled and accept Peter's invitation.

201
00:23:17,725 --> 00:23:21,725
But we want to tell you about that in our next story.
