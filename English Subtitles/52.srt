00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:17,470
Holadio

2
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:24,470
Heidi

3
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,470
Your world are the mountains

4
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,470
Heidi

5
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:36,470
Because up here you are at home

6
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:40,470
Dark firs

7
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:44,470
Green meadows in the sunshine

8
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:48,470
Heidi

9
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:52,470
You need to be happy

10
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:05,470
Heidi

11
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:09,470
Heidi

12
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,470
Come home

13
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,470
Find your happiness

14
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:19,470
Come back home

15
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:34,470
Heidi

16
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:42,470
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1

17
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:42,938
No, no!

18
00:01:42,938 --> 00:01:45,938
Just a little bit more. Good, Clara.

19
00:01:45,938 --> 00:01:51,938
One, two, and one, and two, and three.

20
00:01:51,938 --> 00:01:53,370
You did it!

21
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:57,370
Now no one has to help me anymore. Now I can walk really well.

22
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,370
Really well not yet, but it will be.

23
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,370
Shouldn't we write to the grandmother that she's coming?

24
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,370
Yes, let's do it right away.

25
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:08,370
Good morning, the postman is coming. I have mail for you.

26
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:12,370
She writes that she can come right away. Her cure would be over soon anyway.

27
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:15,370
She writes, she's happy to see you standing.

28
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,370
Me too.

29
00:02:16,592 --> 00:02:19,092
I still haven't told her that I can walk.

30
00:02:19,092 --> 00:02:20,092
That's right.

31
00:02:20,092 --> 00:02:23,092
Is that supposed to mean that the grandmother doesn't know yet?

32
00:02:23,092 --> 00:02:25,092
Yes, I want to surprise her with that.

33
00:02:25,092 --> 00:02:27,592
How can you keep something like that to yourself?

34
00:02:27,592 --> 00:02:29,592
I would have told that to everyone.

35
00:02:29,592 --> 00:02:31,592
You're also a trach aunt.

36
00:02:32,092 --> 00:02:32,960
I want a...

37
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,960
A trach aunt, the chickens are laughing.

38
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,960
Here, listen. She wants to leave on Saturday morning and would be here by noon.

39
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,960
Today is Saturday. Then she'll come today.

40
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:46,960
Of course, as always. I'm not there when she comes and can't take the whole
theater.

41
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,960
That's not a theater.

42
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,960
Something like that.

43
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,960
Grandfather, did she write it too?

44
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,960
Yes, she did.

45
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,125
Stand up, you lazy...

46
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,665
...and go to the meadow with Peter and the goat.

47
00:02:57,665 --> 00:03:00,925
As far as I know Peter, he'll sneak away by noon.

48
00:03:00,925 --> 00:03:02,925
Go on, Joseph, to the meadow.

49
00:03:02,925 --> 00:03:05,925
That's good. That's really good.

50
00:03:06,925 --> 00:03:08,925
You're doing your theatre.

51
00:03:08,925 --> 00:03:10,925
Peter, are you happy now?

52
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:11,925
Yes.

53
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:12,925
Soon.

54
00:03:12,925 --> 00:03:14,925
Come on, it's not too late.

55
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:33,125
You'll hardly ever find her again.

56
00:03:33,391 --> 00:03:36,891
You know, she's tanned and healthy and laughs all day.

57
00:03:36,891 --> 00:03:40,391
I can imagine. When I was little, we were in the mountains, too.

58
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:45,391
Do you still remember? Do you still remember how you rang the church bells?

59
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:52,391
Yes. At least I remember how Father laid me on my knee back then.

60
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:55,365
Who did it hurt more?

61
00:03:55,365 --> 00:03:59,365
Your pants, or Father's hand? You didn't shed a single tear.

62
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:01,865
If I'm honest, it didn't hurt at all.

63
00:04:01,865 --> 00:04:05,365
But when he caught me when I left the dog in the henhouse,

64
00:04:05,365 --> 00:04:08,365
he gave me a little more trouble, and that's when it hurt.

65
00:04:08,365 --> 00:04:11,365
You and your dog, you were inseparable.

66
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:30,223
To be continued...

67
00:04:30,223 --> 00:04:34,523
Mother, Mrs. Sesemann is coming back and a good-looking man is accompanying her.

68
00:04:36,163 --> 00:04:41,763
Maybe that's Clara's father, but Peter didn't tell anything about it. Don't the
children know?

69
00:04:42,303 --> 00:04:45,023
Possibly. It could of course also be the doctor.

70
00:04:45,023 --> 00:04:49,423
I can't tell you anything about it. You saw the doctor back then, didn't you?

71
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:49,923
Yes.

72
00:04:51,523 --> 00:04:53,523
What do you have? What do you think?

73
00:04:53,523 --> 00:04:57,223
Do you think they're taking Heidi away again? They're taking her with them to
Frankfurt?

74
00:04:57,223 --> 00:04:58,523
No, I don't think so.

75
00:04:58,805 --> 00:05:02,805
I hope, I hope you're right, Brigitte.

76
00:05:03,805 --> 00:05:06,805
Welcome! Good day!

77
00:05:06,805 --> 00:05:09,805
Clara, your father, Mr. Sesamann!

78
00:05:09,805 --> 00:05:12,805
Oh, Clara! Clara!

79
00:05:14,805 --> 00:05:17,805
Clara! My child, how are you?

80
00:05:17,805 --> 00:05:19,805
How beautiful!

81
00:05:20,805 --> 00:05:22,805
Oh, Clara.

82
00:05:23,215 --> 00:05:25,215
You've become even more beautiful.

83
00:05:25,215 --> 00:05:27,215
You're all tanned and clean.

84
00:05:27,215 --> 00:05:29,215
You always say that.

85
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:32,215
Grandmother didn't say a word about it.

86
00:05:32,215 --> 00:05:34,215
Yes, I asked her to.

87
00:05:34,215 --> 00:05:36,215
It was supposed to be a big surprise.

88
00:05:36,215 --> 00:05:37,215
She succeeded.

89
00:05:37,215 --> 00:05:39,215
Well, little friend, how are you?

90
00:05:39,215 --> 00:05:40,215
Oh, what am I asking?

91
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:41,215
You can see how you're doing.

92
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:42,215
You look great.

93
00:05:42,215 --> 00:05:45,215
Yes, when she sees our surprise for the first time.

94
00:05:45,215 --> 00:05:46,215
Are you quiet?

95
00:05:46,215 --> 00:05:47,215
I'm sorry.

96
00:05:47,215 --> 00:05:50,215
Clara, Heidi, how are you, children?

97
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,250
Did you just talk about a surprise?

98
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,250
No, great-grandma.

99
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,250
Just look, mother, at how the children look.

100
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,250
Don't they both look gorgeous?

101
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,250
And isn't Heidi really pretty?

102
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,250
You can't even recognize her.

103
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,250
Yes.

104
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,250
Let's welcome the AlmÃ¶hi.

105
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,250
We owe it to him.

106
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,250
I'm glad to have you here.

107
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,250
My father has come along.

108
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,250
Hello.

109
00:06:18,346 --> 00:06:20,346
Do you think we should do it now?

110
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:24,346
Yes, I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything you
have done for Clara.

111
00:06:24,346 --> 00:06:25,346
Not necessary.

112
00:06:25,346 --> 00:06:26,346
And yet, don't be so modest.

113
00:06:26,346 --> 00:06:29,346
You just have to look at my Clara to know everything.

114
00:06:29,346 --> 00:06:31,346
I've never seen my child so radiant.

115
00:06:31,346 --> 00:06:33,346
If you want to thank someone,

116
00:06:33,346 --> 00:06:37,346
then thank the mountains, the holy, Peter and the animals.

117
00:06:37,346 --> 00:06:40,346
Apart from that, I think you should thank them much too early.

118
00:06:40,346 --> 00:06:41,346
Why?

119
00:06:41,346 --> 00:06:45,346
The children have a surprise for you.

120
00:06:45,346 --> 00:06:47,346
Attention!

121
00:06:47,524 --> 00:06:50,524
I think I'm dreaming.

122
00:06:50,524 --> 00:06:52,524
Clara has woken up.

123
00:06:52,524 --> 00:06:54,524
And off she goes.

124
00:06:54,524 --> 00:06:57,524
Look, the child. The child is running.

125
00:06:57,524 --> 00:06:59,524
Clara can run.

126
00:06:59,524 --> 00:07:02,524
The surprise was a success, Clara.

127
00:07:02,524 --> 00:07:04,524
That can't be true.

128
00:07:06,524 --> 00:07:07,524
Clara.

129
00:07:10,524 --> 00:07:12,410
Clara, my child.

130
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,910
Why don't you congratulate me?

131
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:15,910
I don't know.

132
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,910
And he didn't write me a word about it,

133
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,910
where I waited for it so long.

134
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:23,410
If you knew, it wouldn't have been a surprise.

135
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,410
Clara, my little...

136
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,910
What are you saying?

137
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,410
I'm speechless.

138
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,910
My little Clara.

139
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:36,910
Finally I can run, just like other kids.

140

141
00:07:50,212 --> 00:07:53,212
Now we're standing here and crying like little children.

142
00:07:53,212 --> 00:07:55,212
Thank you, Almudie.

143
00:07:55,212 --> 00:07:57,212
I don't know how we can ever do that again.

144
00:07:57,212 --> 00:07:59,212
You don't have to.

145
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,212
Peter, I thank you.

146
00:08:01,212 --> 00:08:03,212
I thank you.

147
00:08:03,212 --> 00:08:07,212
I don't know if I'm awake or if I may have just been dreaming.

148
00:08:07,212 --> 00:08:10,212
Our surprise was quite successful.

149
00:08:10,212 --> 00:08:12,212
Yes, you can say that.

150
00:08:12,212 --> 00:08:14,212
You can say that.

152
00:08:24,452 --> 00:08:29,452
Now they're all coming back and the girl from Frankfurt is wearing the balm oil.

153
00:08:29,452 --> 00:08:33,452
I'm scared, Brigitte. I'm scared that they'll take Heidi with them.

154
00:08:33,452 --> 00:08:35,452
Ask her. She's running towards us.

155
00:08:35,452 --> 00:08:37,452
I'll be right back!

156
00:08:37,452 --> 00:08:39,452
Good day, Grandmother!

157
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:40,132
Heidi!

158
00:08:40,132 --> 00:08:43,132
I'm sorry I haven't been here for so long.

159
00:08:43,132 --> 00:08:47,132
Tell me, child, are you going with them to Frankfurt?

160
00:08:47,132 --> 00:08:49,132
What?

161
00:08:49,132 --> 00:08:52,132
I want to say hello to you too.

162
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:54,132
Hello, Mrs. Sesemann.

163
00:08:54,132 --> 00:08:56,132
I'm so happy.

164
00:08:56,132 --> 00:08:58,132
The children will have told you.

165
00:08:58,132 --> 00:09:00,132
Our Clara can walk.

166
00:09:00,132 --> 00:09:04,959
I had long given up hope that one day it would come true.

167
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,799
Please, may I ask you something?

168
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:10,719
Do you intend to take Heidi with you when you return to Frankfurt?

169
00:09:10,719 --> 00:09:12,959
But no, how do you know that?

170
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,299
Do you still worry about that time?

171
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:17,299
Can't you finally forget that?

172
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:20,299
I couldn't forget it. I always have to think about it.

173
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:21,959
You know, Heidi belongs here.

174
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:23,459
Yes, we know that now.

175
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:27,459
We have learned to understand why Heidi can never feel at ease with us.

176
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:30,459
Heidi belongs here to you and to the mountains.

177
00:09:30,459 --> 00:09:33,459
That is the world in which our Heidi is happy.

178
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:39,841
Heidi, tell your grandmother that you're not going anywhere, so that she
believes it.

179
00:09:39,841 --> 00:09:41,841
I'll stay here.

180
00:09:41,841 --> 00:09:42,841
Yes.

181
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:45,841
Are you calm now? You really don't have to be afraid.

182
00:09:45,841 --> 00:09:48,841
I will never go away from here voluntarily.

183
00:09:48,841 --> 00:09:49,841
Promised.

184
00:09:49,841 --> 00:09:51,841
Yes, of course. This is promised.

185
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,841
And promised is promised and will not be broken.

186
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:58,841
You know that. But you have to promise me now that you will never be afraid.

187
00:09:58,841 --> 00:10:01,841
Please forgive me for being suspicious.

188
00:10:02,655 --> 00:10:06,055
You don't have to apologize to me. I understand.

189
00:10:06,055 --> 00:10:10,255
I just don't want you to worry about anything in the future.

190
00:10:10,255 --> 00:10:13,455
Well, now I have to believe it slowly.

191
00:10:13,455 --> 00:10:16,855
You don't know how much I've worried about myself.

192
00:10:16,855 --> 00:10:18,855
It's over.

193
00:10:19,365 --> 00:10:21,365
It's over.

195
00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:55,209
I'm going to miss that.

196
00:10:55,209 --> 00:10:56,209
What?

197
00:10:56,209 --> 00:10:59,209
When I see you eat, I always get an appetite.

198
00:10:59,209 --> 00:11:02,209
In Frankfurt, I only see Mrs. Rottenmeier.

199
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:05,209
Why Frankfurt?

200
00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:10,209
Oh, because I have to go back, unfortunately.

201
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:12,209
No.

202
00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:15,209
Tell me, you're not serious about that, are you?

203
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:17,209
Is that really serious?

204
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:21,379
Yes, tomorrow they're leaving. Klara is supposed to spend the winter in
Frankfurt.

205
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:24,379
To stay here she's not strong enough yet.

206
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:26,779
Oh, I see.

207
00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:30,479
Don't be so sad. Klara will come back next spring.

208
00:11:30,479 --> 00:11:32,079
That's right.

209
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,279
Yes, at some point I'll have to learn again.

210
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,379
Oh, I see.

211
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:38,779
And you can't do without learning.

212
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:42,679
Yes, I can, but the others won't let me.

213
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:43,268
Frohling!

214
00:11:43,268 --> 00:11:45,268
No, Clara. This pattern you can't do...

215
00:11:45,348 --> 00:11:47,728
...and that you can't do, and this you can't do and that you can't do.

216
00:11:47,768 --> 00:11:49,908
and this, and this you can't do, and this you can't do, and that's not.

217
00:11:49,908 --> 00:11:52,268
Yes, Mrs. Rottenmayr.

218
00:11:52,268 --> 00:11:54,348
Next year you can come on stage with us everywhere.

219
00:11:54,348 --> 00:11:56,348
Yes I know!

220
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:58,348
Come sing something.

221
00:12:01,348 --> 00:12:03,948
If I practise hard the whole winter...

222
00:12:03,948 --> 00:12:06,828
...then next year I can dance with you two.

223
00:12:06,828 --> 00:12:08,828
Yes!

224
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:19,828
The moon has risen, the golden stars are twinkling in the sky.

225
00:12:20,142 --> 00:12:32,142
The forest stands black and silent and rising from the meadows the white fog is
wonderful.

226
00:12:32,142 --> 00:12:41,134
How is the world so quiet and in silence?

227
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:09,030
Good-bye, Swindle. Good-bye, little ghost.

228
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,030
It's about time.

229
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:17,030
Good-bye, Bearly. See you next spring. I'll be back, for sure.

230
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:24,030
Now off to the stable with you until we come back.

231
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,030
Good-bye.

232
00:13:26,554 --> 00:13:28,554
Good-bye, Joseph.

234
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,510
Please, stand still.

235
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,510
All right, Clara.

236
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,510
It's over now.

237
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,510
I'll be dreaming about it now.

238
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:16,510
I won't see it for a long winter.

239
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,510
I'll paint it for you.

240
00:14:23,054 --> 00:14:25,054
Can we go on now?

241
00:14:25,054 --> 00:14:27,054
Yes.

242
00:15:03,523 --> 00:15:05,523
Clara, you are always very welcome.

243
00:15:05,523 --> 00:15:07,523
Yes, I know. Thank you.

244
00:15:07,523 --> 00:15:09,523
Heidi, don't forget me and write to me often.

245
00:15:09,523 --> 00:15:10,523
Yes, please.

246
00:15:10,523 --> 00:15:11,523
Clara, goodbye.

247
00:15:11,523 --> 00:15:14,523
Dear Clara, I'll write to you for sure.

248
00:15:14,523 --> 00:15:16,523
And I'll write to you too.

249
00:15:17,523 --> 00:15:18,523
And you too, Peter.

250
00:15:18,523 --> 00:15:20,523
You don't need that. I don't like to read.

251
00:15:20,523 --> 00:15:22,523
Goodbye, Clara.

252
00:15:22,523 --> 00:15:23,523
Goodbye.

253
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:25,007
Next time we'll see each other again.

254
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:28,007
Don't forget to write. Goodbye. åè§.

One grape is more beautiful than the other.

275
00:17:06,207 --> 00:17:07,307
Dear Heidio...

276
00:17:07,363 --> 00:17:09,363
Today I'm writing a whole magazine.

277
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:11,363
The warm bed is for the grandmother.

278
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,363
Grandmother wants her to have it.

279
00:17:16,363 --> 00:17:20,363
Dear Heidi, today I can only write a short letter.

280
00:17:20,363 --> 00:17:23,363
The candidate has now added a new subject.

281
00:17:23,363 --> 00:17:26,363
And that concerns me very much, because it is very difficult.

282
00:17:27,363 --> 00:17:29,363
Geometry.

283
00:17:34,968 --> 00:17:42,968
One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one.

284
00:17:42,968 --> 00:17:48,968
Wonderful, Mrs. Clara. If you keep going like this, you'll soon be able to go
back to the mountains.

285
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:51,968
You have nothing against it?

286
00:17:51,968 --> 00:17:53,968
Nothing.

287
00:18:25,044 --> 00:18:35,044
Thank you for watching and see you in the next video!

288
00:18:35,096 --> 00:18:38,096
What do you see out there?

289
00:18:38,096 --> 00:18:40,096
Grey sky, snowflakes and snow.

290
00:18:40,096 --> 00:18:44,096
And what's so special about it? Why do you have to stare at it all the time?

291
00:18:44,096 --> 00:18:45,096
I see.

292
00:18:45,096 --> 00:18:48,096
I want the snow to disappear so that Clara can come.

293
00:18:48,096 --> 00:18:51,096
That will take a long time. How is she doing? Has she written again?

294
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:52,096
Good.

295
00:18:52,096 --> 00:18:53,096
Aha.

296
00:18:53,096 --> 00:18:55,096
She's already climbing stairs.

298
00:19:34,712 --> 00:19:36,712
The sun is getting warmer.

299
00:19:36,712 --> 00:19:38,712
Yes, it is.

300
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:41,712
Shall we go?

301
00:19:41,712 --> 00:19:42,712
From me?

302
00:19:58,712 --> 00:20:00,712
A train is falling!

303
00:20:04,712 --> 00:20:07,712
Nice, like a toy!

304
00:20:07,992 --> 00:20:11,992
If we get in there, we could visit Clara.

305
00:20:12,992 --> 00:20:14,992
And she could visit us.

306
00:20:14,992 --> 00:20:19,940
Hello! Railway! Bring us Clara!

307
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,380
Hello, railway! Bring us Clara!

308
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:39,940
Clara!

309
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,300
Hi, Peter! I'm here!

310
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,940
Hi!

311
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,869
It wasn't too late.

312
00:21:17,869 --> 00:21:23,869
Heidi, Peter and Clara were still only dreaming about the colorful flower
meadows.

313
00:21:23,869 --> 00:21:29,869
But they knew that one day it would be exactly the same as they imagined it to
be.

314
00:21:29,869 --> 00:21:34,369
They knew that this day would come and that it wouldn't take that long anymore.

315
00:21:34,369 --> 00:21:37,869
And they were looking forward to it.

316
00:21:45,645 --> 00:21:48,145
Oh, what a shame. It was all just a dream.

317
00:21:48,145 --> 00:21:52,145
I'm going crazy now. Did I really pull the curtain out?

318
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:54,645
Put it back on quickly, or you'll catch a cold.

319
00:21:54,645 --> 00:21:57,645
For a moment I thought it was really coming through the snow.

320
00:21:57,645 --> 00:21:59,645
What a shame. What a shame.

321
00:22:00,825 --> 00:22:02,825
What a shame.

322
00:22:30,825 --> 00:22:34,825
What a shame.

323
00:22:49,825 --> 00:22:57,825
Heidi, Heidi, your world is the mountains,

324
00:22:57,825 --> 00:22:58,825
Heidi, Heidi, your world is the mountains,

325
00:22:58,825 --> 00:23:00,825
Heidi, Heidi, your world is the mountains,

326
00:23:00,825 --> 00:23:05,825
Because up here you are at home

327
00:23:05,825 --> 00:23:09,825
Heidi, Heidi

328
00:23:09,825 --> 00:23:11,825
Come home

329
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:13,825
Find your happiness

330
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:18,825
Come back again
