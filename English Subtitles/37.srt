00:00:04,494 --> 00:00:09,494
Holadio

2
00:00:12,494 --> 00:00:17,494
Holadio

3
00:00:20,494 --> 00:00:24,494
Heidi, Heidi

4
00:00:24,494 --> 00:00:28,494
Your world are the mountains

5
00:00:28,494 --> 00:00:32,494
Heidi, Heidi

6
00:00:32,494 --> 00:00:36,494
Because up here you are at home

7
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:40,494
Dark firs

8
00:00:40,494 --> 00:00:44,494
Green meadows in the sunshine

9
00:00:44,494 --> 00:00:48,494
Heidi, Heidi

10
00:00:48,494 --> 00:00:52,494
You need to be happy

11
00:00:52,494 --> 00:00:56,494
Holadio, Holadio, Holadio, Holadio, Holadio

12
00:00:56,494 --> 00:01:00,494
Holadio, Holadio, Holadio, Holadio, Holadio

13
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:02,494
Holadio

14
00:01:02,494 --> 00:01:06,494
Holadio, Holadio, Holadio, Holadio

15
00:01:06,494 --> 00:01:10,494
Heidi, Heidi

16
00:01:10,494 --> 00:01:12,494
Come home

17
00:01:12,494 --> 00:01:14,494
Find your happiness

18
00:01:14,494 --> 00:01:18,494
Come back home

19
00:01:28,494 --> 00:01:30,494
Let's see if the little goat is already here.

20
00:01:30,494 --> 00:01:32,494
Grandfather, is the little goat already here?

21
00:01:32,494 --> 00:01:34,494
Good morning, Heidi.

22
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:36,494
Bye

23
00:01:36,634 --> 00:01:38,634
It's still so thick. What a shame!

24
00:01:38,634 --> 00:01:41,634
It will take some time. And I could have sworn that it would be done today.

25
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:45,634
Yes, it will take some time. And I was so looking forward to the new one.

26
00:01:45,634 --> 00:01:49,634
Have patience, Hailey. Nature does not follow what we want.

27
00:01:49,634 --> 00:01:51,634
Yes, I know.

28
00:01:51,634 --> 00:01:54,634
Hurry up a little, my love. Yes, Swanley?

29
00:01:54,634 --> 00:01:56,634
There, Peter!

30
00:01:56,634 --> 00:01:58,634
Is it already done with Swanley?

31
00:01:58,634 --> 00:02:00,634
Unfortunately not yet. It will take some time.

32
00:02:00,634 --> 00:02:01,626
Yes, I thought so.

33
00:02:01,626 --> 00:02:03,626
Why?

34
00:02:03,626 --> 00:02:05,626
That's usually the case.

35
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,626
Aren't you disappointed?

36
00:02:07,626 --> 00:02:09,626
Huh?

37
00:02:09,626 --> 00:02:11,626
Peter has already seen so many newborn goats.

38
00:02:11,626 --> 00:02:13,626
But not this one!

39
00:02:13,626 --> 00:02:16,626
Huh? I was supposed to hand over a letter, man.

40
00:02:16,626 --> 00:02:19,626
Then I almost forgot again.

41
00:02:19,626 --> 00:02:21,626
There.

42
00:02:21,626 --> 00:02:24,626
The letter is from Clara.

43
00:02:24,626 --> 00:02:25,626
Clara?

44
00:02:25,626 --> 00:02:27,424
Here, for you.

45
00:02:27,424 --> 00:02:32,424
A letter for me from Clara Sesemann from Frankfurt. A letter for me from Clara
Sesemann from Frankfurt.

46
00:02:35,424 --> 00:02:40,424
Clara wrote it! A letter from Clara!

47
00:02:41,498 --> 00:02:45,698
Clara Sesemann wrote me a letter.

48
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:47,898
Now just say you can read.

49
00:02:47,898 --> 00:02:49,498
Of course I can read.

50
00:02:49,498 --> 00:02:50,698
Heidi!

51
00:02:50,698 --> 00:02:53,298
You didn't tell me at all that you can read.

52
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,998
Yes, and?

53
00:02:54,998 --> 00:02:57,698
I learned it in Frankfurt. Why?

54
00:02:57,698 --> 00:02:59,098
Come on, let's go.

55
00:02:59,098 --> 00:03:02,298
It's from Clara Sesemann.

56
00:03:02,298 --> 00:03:05,598
Puh, who's Clara Sesemann?

57
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:08,898
Dear Heidi, is it nice in the mountains?

58
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:11,198
Yes, it is!

59
00:03:11,283 --> 00:03:13,283
I hope you're doing well.

60
00:03:13,283 --> 00:03:17,283
It was nice when you were there.

61
00:03:17,283 --> 00:03:21,283
Dad went to Paris again.

62
00:03:21,283 --> 00:03:25,283
So he didn't keep the promise he gave you.

63
00:03:25,283 --> 00:03:28,283
It's all the same as it used to be.

64
00:03:28,283 --> 00:03:31,283
Miss Rottenmeier hasn't changed either.

65
00:03:31,283 --> 00:03:34,283
I have to do what she asks of me.

66
00:03:34,283 --> 00:03:37,283
I talk a lot with Hansi now, as if it were you.

67
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:40,283
School hours are boring without you too.

68
00:03:40,947 --> 00:03:45,347
Sometimes Sebastian takes me for a walk in the yard,

69
00:03:45,347 --> 00:03:49,347
but that's also the most exciting thing I've ever experienced.

70
00:03:51,347 --> 00:03:53,347
Poor Clara.

71
00:03:55,347 --> 00:03:59,947
If only I could at least imagine what you do all day long.

72
00:03:59,947 --> 00:04:02,947
Are you going for a walk with Joseph?

73
00:04:03,947 --> 00:04:05,947
I'm so sorry.

74
00:04:05,947 --> 00:04:08,947
You still haven't had breakfast.

75
00:04:08,947 --> 00:04:10,947
Are you sad?

76
00:04:11,027 --> 00:04:14,027
It's not a very funny letter, Grandfather.

77
00:04:16,427 --> 00:04:19,427
Clara is all alone. Read it.

78
00:04:23,627 --> 00:04:26,627
Do you think she wants to visit us?

79
00:04:26,627 --> 00:04:30,627
Yes, she definitely wants to. That's what she's always said.

80
00:04:30,627 --> 00:04:33,227
Besides, it would be very good for her health.

81
00:04:33,227 --> 00:04:35,027
That could be.

82
00:04:35,027 --> 00:04:39,347
Mountain air is healthy. Why shouldn't it also help your Clara?

83
00:04:39,347 --> 00:04:42,147
We both should invite your girlfriend.

84
00:04:42,147 --> 00:04:46,447
Can I write to her right away? She should pack her suitcase right away and come
to visit us.

85
00:04:46,447 --> 00:04:49,447
Yes. Here is the address.

86
00:04:49,447 --> 00:04:51,447
Thank you.

87
00:04:54,747 --> 00:05:01,647
When you come soon, you will see Swinley's little chick.

88
00:05:05,747 --> 00:05:07,947
Can one read your writing?

89
00:05:07,947 --> 00:05:09,203
But I...

90
00:05:09,203 --> 00:05:13,003
Dear Clara, Grandfather and I would like to invite you.

91
00:05:13,203 --> 00:05:18,003
When you come back, you'll see Swindy's little chick.

92
00:05:22,203 --> 00:05:24,003
Do you think that's enough?

93
00:05:27,003 --> 00:05:29,003
Did I do something wrong?

94
00:05:30,003 --> 00:05:33,003
No, child, you didn't do anything wrong.

95
00:05:33,203 --> 00:05:35,003
Do you think Swindy can wait that long?

96
00:05:35,203 --> 00:05:36,419
I see.

97
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,419
Yes, you're right. I'm writing that she should hurry.

98
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:40,419
Do it.

99
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:43,419
Can't I go visit Peter's grandmother today?

100
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:48,419
She has a thick book with fairy tales and she always wanted Peter to read
something to her.

101
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:50,419
Peter? Can he read?

102
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:51,419
No.

103
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:53,419
And that's why you want to read to her.

104
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:56,419
Good, but I'll go with you and repair the hut.

105
00:05:56,419 --> 00:05:58,419
Oh yes, grandfather, let's do that.

106
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:07,680
THE END

107
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,680
First you have to come in and tell her that we're here.

108
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,680
The last time she got so scared when you started to tap her nails, do you know
that?

109
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,680
Good morning, good morning, grandmother!

110
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,680
Oh, Heidi!

111
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,680
Yes, me, Heidi. And I even brought someone with me.

112
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,680
Isn't Peter with the goats?

113
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,680
Yes, but grandfather came with us. He wants to repair your hut again.

114
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,680
The Almö.

115
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,680
You can start now, I told him.

116
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,680
That's very nice of you, Almö. Thank you very much.

117
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,680
You're welcome.

118
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,560
That's all we have to thank Heidi for.

119
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,560
What are you doing? I can't hear you.

120
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,560
You're in the cabin.

121
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,560
Did you bump into something? Did you hurt yourself?

122
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,152
A farmer has...

123
00:07:05,152 --> 00:07:11,152
I had a son who was so pale and immaculate that his father...

124
00:07:11,152 --> 00:07:14,152
That's a Swiss fairy tale.

125
00:07:14,152 --> 00:07:16,152
I can read it.

126
00:07:16,152 --> 00:07:21,152
Yes? Brigitte, what do you say to that?

127
00:07:21,152 --> 00:07:26,152
Please Heidi, read it to me, as long as you want.

128
00:07:26,152 --> 00:07:28,152
I'd love to.

129
00:07:28,152 --> 00:07:30,646
Where was I?

130
00:07:30,646 --> 00:07:35,646
When the father came to his senses, he did what he could not dare to do.

131
00:07:35,646 --> 00:07:43,646
First, he put a straw man into the church tower and then sent the boy up to the
tower at night to open the clock.

132
00:07:50,272 --> 00:07:52,272
A light burned on the table.

133
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:59,272
While he wanted to make himself comfortable, two men came into the room, who
supported him for some time.

134
00:07:59,272 --> 00:08:04,272
But then, after a short conversation, he was told that the house had no master
anymore, because it was haunted.

135
00:08:04,272 --> 00:08:08,272
But this circumstance serves them for their thievery.

136
00:08:08,272 --> 00:08:12,272
To be able to hide here, when the companion asked the closer one?

137
00:08:12,272 --> 00:08:14,272
I liked that as a child.

138
00:08:14,272 --> 00:08:19,272
But a woman's hut here, a treasure. Why do I have to read it if you know it by
heart?

139
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,430
I'm having a lot of fun.

140
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:24,430
Keep reading until grandfather is finished, okay?

141
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:29,430
And appear regularly at the ghost hour.

142
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:32,430
Now they have united for the third time today to lift this treasure.

143
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:45,160
As soon as the midnight hour was over, they heard someone calling.

144
00:08:51,712 --> 00:08:56,712
And then the wild son handed over the white woman and got the treasure.

145
00:08:56,712 --> 00:08:58,712
Why are you crying when he got it?

146
00:08:58,712 --> 00:09:01,712
I don't know. Just like that.

147
00:09:02,712 --> 00:09:07,712
I'm glad you learned to read so well. I'm very, very proud of you.

148
00:09:07,712 --> 00:09:11,712
It was hard. So many letters.

149
00:09:11,712 --> 00:09:12,712
Heidi?

150
00:09:12,712 --> 00:09:13,712
Oh.

151
00:09:13,712 --> 00:09:14,712
Are you coming?

152
00:09:14,712 --> 00:09:19,712
Yes, soon. There are more fairy tales in the book. I'll read them again next
time if you want.

153
00:09:19,913 --> 00:09:24,413
But of course I want to. And how much? I can't wait.

154
00:09:24,413 --> 00:09:26,413
I'll come as soon as I can.

155
00:09:26,413 --> 00:09:28,413
I'm looking forward to it.

156
00:09:28,413 --> 00:09:29,913
Goodbye, Brigitte.

157
00:09:29,913 --> 00:09:31,413
Say thank you to all of them.

158
00:09:31,413 --> 00:09:32,413
Yes.

159
00:09:35,413 --> 00:09:36,913
Oh, this Heidi.

160
00:09:36,913 --> 00:09:39,913
I just hope that no one will take us away from here.

161
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:40,913
Yes.

162
00:09:41,097 --> 00:09:45,097
Do you know how many years I haven't thought about this fairy tale?

163
00:09:45,097 --> 00:09:48,097
I can't even count how many there are.

164
00:09:48,097 --> 00:09:52,097
When you were a little girl, I often read to you.

165
00:09:52,097 --> 00:09:55,097
Now I know at least what was good about Frankfurt.

166
00:09:55,097 --> 00:09:56,761
I learned to read there.

167
00:09:56,761 --> 00:09:59,461
Not only that, you also found a girlfriend, didn't you?

168
00:09:59,461 --> 00:10:03,261
Yes, Clara. We mustn't forget to send her the letter later.

169
00:10:03,261 --> 00:10:07,761
Unfortunately, we don't have a postcard. We'd better give it to Peter tonight.

170
00:10:07,761 --> 00:10:10,761
Clara also has a grandmother. A merciful woman.

171
00:10:10,761 --> 00:10:13,761
Mrs. Rottenmeier wanted me to call her that.

172
00:10:13,761 --> 00:10:14,761
And do you have one?

173
00:10:14,761 --> 00:10:16,261
Really not.

174
00:10:16,261 --> 00:10:19,761
Clara's grandmother was far too nice to call her a merciful woman.

175
00:10:19,761 --> 00:10:21,261
I called her grandmother.

176
00:10:21,261 --> 00:10:24,261
Hopefully she had nothing against it.

177
00:10:24,313 --> 00:10:27,813
She said that she wouldn't be a grandmother just for Clara.

178
00:10:28,313 --> 00:10:29,313
She was nice.

179
00:10:29,313 --> 00:10:30,313
And how!

180
00:10:31,967 --> 00:10:36,967
。・゚・ ・。

181
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:51,067
Here, look! ・゚・ ・。

182
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:51,567
Here, look!

183
00:10:52,867 --> 00:10:54,567
I learned it with that! ・゚・ ・。

184
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:55,067
Yeah? ・゚・ ・。

185
00:11:01,967 --> 00:11:06,967
THE LADY AND THE MONSTER

186
00:11:13,367 --> 00:11:14,967
There. Finished.

187
00:11:15,155 --> 00:11:18,155
Tell me, didn't you want to write something?

188
00:11:18,155 --> 00:11:20,155
No, send it like this, yes?

189
00:11:20,155 --> 00:11:21,155
Like this?

190
00:11:21,155 --> 00:11:22,155
Please.

191
00:11:22,155 --> 00:11:27,155
Can you imagine that you give a wet, disgusting frog a kiss?

192
00:11:27,155 --> 00:11:31,155
Oh, you're just reading the fairy tale of the Frog King.

193
00:11:31,155 --> 00:11:36,155
You know it? I've always read the fairy tale in Frankfurt.

195
00:12:04,878 --> 00:12:07,878
Tell me, don't you want to go to school?

196
00:12:08,878 --> 00:12:10,878
Did you just say something?

197
00:12:11,878 --> 00:12:13,878
I don't think so.

198
00:12:16,878 --> 00:12:20,878
Heidi, it's getting late. Go to bed now, please.

199
00:12:21,878 --> 00:12:23,878
Bye bye, Hansel and Gretel.

200
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:46,878
To be continued...

201
00:12:47,078 --> 00:12:50,078
Yes, it can't be any other way.

202
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:59,270
And what if the little goat is born today? I should go.

203
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:03,270
Don't worry. If she came today, he would have said so.

204
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:06,270
And if you're not right?

205
00:13:10,982 --> 00:13:12,982
What do you want?

206
00:13:12,982 --> 00:13:14,982
You understand me very well.

207
00:13:14,982 --> 00:13:16,982
I want to rent your house for the winter.

208
00:13:16,982 --> 00:13:18,982
I have nothing against it, but you're not the only one.

209
00:13:18,982 --> 00:13:20,982
I assume you're afraid that I can't pay.

210
00:13:20,982 --> 00:13:22,982
Oh, what?

211
00:13:22,982 --> 00:13:24,982
Someone recently came out of town.

212
00:13:24,982 --> 00:13:26,982
He really wants to have it for his many grandchildren.

213
00:13:26,982 --> 00:13:28,982
I want to rent it.

214
00:13:28,982 --> 00:13:30,982
What?

215
00:13:30,982 --> 00:13:32,982
Tell me, Almö, you seem to be

216
00:13:32,982 --> 00:13:34,982
really serious about it.

217
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:36,982
If you pay in advance, I would let you talk to me about it.

218
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,972
Wendy is right.

219
00:13:38,972 --> 00:13:41,372
I'll sell the new one, and then you'll get the money.

220
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:43,372
Is that agreed?

221
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,172
Yes. Why should we let a stranger into the village?

222
00:13:46,372 --> 00:13:48,372
Thank you. You'll hear from me.

223
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:57,534
I wonder what he's up to again.

224
00:14:07,534 --> 00:14:09,534
It's gone!

225
00:14:09,574 --> 00:14:11,574
Maybe he went into the village.

226
00:14:14,074 --> 00:14:16,074
There's something with Swendy.

227
00:14:17,074 --> 00:14:18,074
Swendy?

228
00:14:19,574 --> 00:14:21,574
Heidi, I'll pick you up tomorrow!

229
00:14:21,574 --> 00:14:22,574
Peter!

230
00:14:23,074 --> 00:14:24,574
Come quickly, Peter, please!

231
00:14:24,574 --> 00:14:25,574
Swendy is sick!

232
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:26,574
Come quickly!

233
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:27,574
Oh, what?

234
00:14:28,774 --> 00:14:31,774
Poor little Swenie. I'm really sorry.

235
00:14:31,774 --> 00:14:34,774
It's all right. It'll be all right soon.

236
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:35,774
That's all.

237
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:38,774
You think so? Grandfather, here it comes!

238
00:14:38,774 --> 00:14:40,774
It won't take very long.

239
00:14:40,774 --> 00:14:42,774
I think it'll be quick.

240
00:14:42,774 --> 00:14:44,774
She looks like it.

241
00:14:46,774 --> 00:14:48,774
Maybe tonight.

242
00:14:48,774 --> 00:14:50,774
Or tomorrow morning.

243
00:14:50,774 --> 00:14:52,774
That's exactly what I thought.

244
00:14:52,774 --> 00:14:54,774
At the latest tomorrow morning?

245
00:14:54,774 --> 00:14:56,774
Exactly.

246
00:14:58,774 --> 00:14:59,737
We'll see.

247
00:14:59,737 --> 00:15:02,737
Hopefully it will be a girl.

248
00:15:05,737 --> 00:15:07,737
Do you know what I'll do then?

249
00:15:07,737 --> 00:15:12,737
Then I'll feed her with the most beautiful, greenest and freshest herbs in the
world.

250
00:15:13,737 --> 00:15:17,737
Do you think she will be painted white or black or something like that for the
little blonde?

251
00:15:17,737 --> 00:15:19,737
Are there also striped ones?

252
00:15:19,737 --> 00:15:22,737
That would be quite funny, wouldn't it?

253
00:15:24,737 --> 00:15:28,687
Tell me, were you downstairs today in the village to buy bread?

254
00:15:28,687 --> 00:15:31,687
Yes, that's right. Here, take your cheese.

255
00:15:33,187 --> 00:15:35,187
Maybe she'll be here soon.

256
00:15:48,921 --> 00:15:50,921
Still nothing.

257
00:15:50,921 --> 00:15:52,921
Be patient, Heidi.

258
00:15:52,921 --> 00:15:54,921
Yes.

259

260
00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:26,329
I fell asleep! He took me to bed!

261
00:16:29,329 --> 00:16:31,329
Grandfather! Grandfather!

262
00:16:31,329 --> 00:16:33,329
Is she there? Is she born?

263
00:16:33,329 --> 00:16:35,329
You can guess three times!

264
00:16:38,329 --> 00:16:40,329
Sweet!

265
00:16:42,233 --> 00:16:44,233
Such a little one.

266
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:50,409
What's she doing all of a sudden?

267
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,409
She's just trying to stand up.

268
00:16:54,409 --> 00:16:56,409
Bye.

269
00:16:59,961 --> 00:17:03,961
A little bit more, a little bit more, then you've done it!

270
00:17:04,961 --> 00:17:06,961
Well done!

271
00:17:14,961 --> 00:17:17,961
Hooray, hooray, hooray! We have a new little goat!

272
00:17:17,961 --> 00:17:19,961
A pretty one!

Subtitles by Stephanie Geiges

274
00:17:31,001 --> 00:17:33,801
Have you ever seen such a little goat before?

275
00:17:33,801 --> 00:17:35,001
Every year.

276
00:17:35,001 --> 00:17:39,001
That's not true. Last year we didn't have a boy.

277
00:17:39,001 --> 00:17:43,001
If we ever want to get to the top of the moat, we have to go now.

278
00:17:43,001 --> 00:17:48,001
But I can't go to the moat today. I have to look after my little goat.

279
00:17:48,001 --> 00:17:51,001
Yes, of course. I feared that.

280
00:17:53,001 --> 00:17:56,001
What name should we give her, grandfather?

281
00:17:56,001 --> 00:17:58,001
I don't know.

282
00:17:58,001 --> 00:17:59,811
Vivienne?

283
00:17:59,811 --> 00:18:02,811
What does it mean with little? But that doesn't work when she's big.

284
00:18:02,811 --> 00:18:06,811
It's a pity that Sweeney is already called that. She looks like Sweeney.

285
00:18:06,811 --> 00:18:09,811
But we can call her Sweeney Two.

286
00:18:13,811 --> 00:18:16,811
Is something wrong, Grandfather?

287
00:18:16,811 --> 00:18:17,811
Yes?

288
00:18:17,811 --> 00:18:20,811
It doesn't make sense to come up with a name for her.

289
00:18:20,811 --> 00:18:22,811
Every goat has to have a name.

290
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:25,811
We will sell the little goat soon.

291
00:18:28,268 --> 00:18:33,268
We will rent a house in the village in the winter and I need the money for that.

292
00:18:33,268 --> 00:18:36,268
I want you to go to school regularly from now on.

293
00:18:36,268 --> 00:18:38,268
But what am I supposed to do there?

294
00:18:38,268 --> 00:18:41,268
All of a sudden. You always wanted to go to school before.

295
00:18:41,268 --> 00:18:44,268
Not anymore. I want to keep the goat.

296
00:18:44,268 --> 00:18:47,268
Heide, unfortunately it can't be any other way.

297
00:18:47,268 --> 00:18:50,268
I have watched you in the last few days.

298
00:18:50,268 --> 00:18:53,268
You are a smart girl who can learn a lot.

299
00:18:53,268 --> 00:18:55,268
Please don't give the little goat away.

300
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:57,074
Soon we will have another one.

301
00:18:57,074 --> 00:19:03,074
The little goat will be sold in the village. You can see her every day in the
meadow.

302
00:19:03,274 --> 00:19:04,274
No, still!

303
00:19:04,474 --> 00:19:07,474
No, not still!

304
00:19:10,668 --> 00:19:12,668
It has to be.

305
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,240
So, is Swinley no longer fit?

306
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,740
No, how can she be? She brought the boys to the world last night.

307
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,740
Well, then you can pay.

308
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,740
Somehow I can't sell the goat anymore.

309
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,240
But in spring I will be able to pay.

310
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,740
I'll be carving toys all winter.

311
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:57,240
The things sell well and it brings a lot of money.

312
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,240
Oh, you know, I would prefer if you would pay me in advance.

313
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,740
Of course.

314
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,240
You're still the old fat ass.

315
00:20:07,394 --> 00:20:10,594
That's possible, but I need the money right now.

316
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:13,994
I have to finish the house for the winter.

317
00:20:14,194 --> 00:20:15,594
I would have done that myself.

318
00:20:15,794 --> 00:20:17,994
I'd rather not. That can't be a problem.

319
00:20:18,194 --> 00:20:21,794
Well, keep your house.

320
00:20:21,994 --> 00:20:23,594
What does that mean all of a sudden?

321
00:20:23,794 --> 00:20:28,794
You know exactly. You can rent it to whomever you want, but not to me.

322
00:20:29,176 --> 00:20:33,176
You can rent it to whomever you want, but not to me.

324
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:21,079
If you were with me, I'd call you little ghost, you know?

325
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:24,079
You're a little ghost, too.

326
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:26,079
Heidi!

327
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:28,079
Who took her?

328
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:30,079
We're going to keep her.

329
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:32,079
Well, what do you say?

330
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:34,079
Why, Grandfather?

331
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:37,079
Are we going to stay up here in the hut all of a sudden?

332
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:39,079
Not that. We'll take another house.

333
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:41,989
Why? Why all of a sudden?

334
00:21:41,989 --> 00:21:47,489
I've been thinking about it. I've found another house. It's very dilapidated,
but it'll be fine.

335
00:21:47,489 --> 00:21:48,489
I don't care!

336
00:21:48,489 --> 00:21:54,489
I'll set it up for us for the winter. We'll feel good there. Besides, we don't
have to pay anything.

337
00:21:54,489 --> 00:21:58,989
So we don't need any more money for rent and can keep the ghost?

338
00:21:58,989 --> 00:22:00,989
Yes, we can keep your ghost.

339
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:03,989
Thank you, Grandfather!

340
00:22:04,989 --> 00:22:07,989
I have to go down to the village and see the house every day.

341
00:22:07,989 --> 00:22:10,989
Do you think, Heidi, you can take care of the little one alone?

342
00:22:10,989 --> 00:22:11,573
Yes, of course!

343
00:22:11,573 --> 00:22:13,573
Why shouldn't I be able to do that?

344
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,919
Little ghost, run slowly, little ghost.

345
00:22:28,351 --> 00:22:31,351
You're good at falling, but not yet at running!

346
00:22:49,631 --> 00:22:58,631
Every day the grandfather went up to Dörfli and repaired, to the amazement of
the villagers, the half-torn house in which he wanted to move in with Heidi.

347
00:22:58,631 --> 00:23:03,631
Heidi was a little sad that she should no longer see her beloved Tannen for so
long.

348
00:23:03,631 --> 00:23:08,631
But then she was very happy with the new house down in Dörfli.

349
00:23:08,631 --> 00:23:11,631
She was only worried about Peter's grandmother.

350
00:23:12,037 --> 00:23:16,917
And she asked the grandfather to help, so that she would also have a nice warm
winter.

351
00:23:16,917 --> 00:23:19,157
This year there was a lot of snow.

352
00:23:19,157 --> 00:23:21,557
Peter and Heidi saw each other very rarely.

353
00:23:21,557 --> 00:23:24,837
You can imagine how angry Peter was about it.
