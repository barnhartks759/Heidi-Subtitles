1
00:01:42,842 --> 00:01:46,842
Peter didn't play with the other boys on the village road anymore.

2
00:01:46,842 --> 00:01:49,842
He went up to the mountains with his goats like every morning.

3
00:01:49,842 --> 00:01:53,842
A few days ago, getting up early was a bit annoying for him.

4
00:01:53,842 --> 00:01:58,842
But since there was Heidi, he could hardly wait to get to the alps.

5
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:09,426
Oh, it's unbearably hot again today.

6
00:02:09,426 --> 00:02:13,426
Please be so kind and give the alp the letter when you pass by, yes?

7
00:02:13,426 --> 00:02:15,426
But don't lose it on the way.

8
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:16,426
A letter for the old one?

9
00:02:16,426 --> 00:02:18,426
Yes, be careful.

10
00:02:18,426 --> 00:02:21,426
But do me a favor, don't open the letter.

11
00:02:21,426 --> 00:02:24,426
I can see it at the tip of your nose that you're curious,

12
00:02:24,426 --> 00:02:26,426
but the affairs of other people don't concern you.

13
00:02:26,426 --> 00:02:29,426
But when you get it out, you can tell me.

14
00:02:29,426 --> 00:02:31,426
Well then, live well.

15
00:02:59,055 --> 00:03:03,055
Try a little higher. You see, it's already working.

16
00:03:07,057 --> 00:03:10,013
Always open and close, open and close.

17
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:22,717
But Piep, how can you just stand there like that? Josef, come with us!

18
00:03:26,257 --> 00:03:31,257
Heidi, leave the bird alone. If he's old enough, he'll fly by himself.

19
00:03:31,257 --> 00:03:33,257
Come on.

20
00:03:33,257 --> 00:03:36,257
Well, can't he fly wonderfully?

21
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,053
Josef!

22
00:03:42,353 --> 00:03:45,353
If he goes on like this, I can let him go soon.

23
00:03:45,353 --> 00:03:47,353
Then he can fly away with the other birds.

24
00:03:47,353 --> 00:03:49,353
But he will fly best of all.

25
00:03:49,353 --> 00:03:52,353
Certainly, but now he should be quite big and strong once.

26
00:03:52,353 --> 00:03:55,353
Give your bird a little peace, Heidi.

27
00:03:55,353 --> 00:03:58,353
Do you think you need a little peace, Pete Matz?

28
00:03:58,353 --> 00:04:01,181
Or do we want to continue with the flight lesson?

29
00:04:10,641 --> 00:04:14,641
No, Heidi still wants something from you. She has a bird now. Stay!

30
00:04:14,641 --> 00:04:19,641
Come here. I taught Pete to fly yesterday. Go, fly!

31
00:04:19,641 --> 00:04:21,641
Did you see?

32
00:04:23,641 --> 00:04:25,641
She doesn't need you anymore.

33
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:41,729
We won't wait any longer.

34
00:04:50,353 --> 00:04:52,353
But why aren't you waiting for us?

35
00:04:56,913 --> 00:04:58,473
I'll show it to him again!

36
00:04:58,473 --> 00:05:00,713
If I catch him, I'll make him...

37
00:05:04,713 --> 00:05:08,913
Now I didn't give the letter to Alm-Öhi out of anger.

38
00:05:17,393 --> 00:05:19,393
I don't care about this letter.

39
00:05:19,393 --> 00:05:21,393
Let them see how they can get a letter on their own.

40
00:05:30,609 --> 00:05:33,609
- Why alone? - Who's going with us?

41
00:05:33,609 --> 00:05:35,609
Piep. Piep is with me.

42
00:05:35,609 --> 00:05:38,609
Piep has to see the mountains. We only need an escort.

43
00:05:38,609 --> 00:05:41,609
Can I take Käse with me?

44
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:09,400
There are your friends up there. Why don't you fly to them and show them what
you've already learned?

45
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,400
You can do it just as well as they can. At least try it once.

46
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,400
So what did I tell you? You just have to dare.

47
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,200
You have to try to get up.

48
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,200
Then come on. I know it's hard.

49
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,200
Don't be sad. In a few days it will be much better.

50
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,200
We both can do it.

51
00:06:53,768 --> 00:06:55,768
Mr. Peep, say good day to him.

52
00:06:59,528 --> 00:07:04,528
Come on, let me catch him. Don't be so stupid.

53
00:07:04,528 --> 00:07:07,528
Peep has never flown such a long distance before.

54
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:10,528
You know what, Peter? I think he likes you.

55
00:07:10,528 --> 00:07:13,528
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

56
00:07:13,528 --> 00:07:15,528
Do you have a problem?

57
00:07:15,528 --> 00:07:18,528
I couldn't guess you wanted to come.

58
00:07:18,528 --> 00:07:21,528
Why are you in such a bad mood?

59
00:07:21,528 --> 00:07:23,508
What is it?

60
00:07:25,224 --> 00:07:30,224
There you have your letter. That's why you came. And Billy didn't agree. I
wanted to keep it.

61
00:07:30,224 --> 00:07:32,224
What am I supposed to do with it?

62
00:07:33,224 --> 00:07:36,224
Read it. And now take it and bring it to your grandfather.

63
00:07:36,224 --> 00:07:38,224
I don't understand anything.

64
00:07:40,224 --> 00:07:44,224
Well, if you don't want to, then I'll hand over the letter on the way back
myself.

65
00:07:44,224 --> 00:07:47,224
Sometimes you understand terribly slowly.

66
00:07:48,224 --> 00:07:52,224
Now I know what you mean. You're hungry again. I already thought about it.

67
00:07:52,224 --> 00:07:54,222
There, get it out.

68
00:07:54,222 --> 00:07:57,222
I asked my grandfather for a cheese for you.

69
00:07:58,722 --> 00:08:00,222
Cheese?

70
00:08:00,222 --> 00:08:01,722
Of course, what did you think?

71
00:08:01,722 --> 00:08:03,722
Do you think I forgot what you like?

72
00:08:03,722 --> 00:08:05,722
Yes, I thought so.

73
00:08:06,722 --> 00:08:08,222
Actually, he's very nice.

74
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:10,222
Sometimes you don't understand very quickly.

75
00:08:35,496 --> 00:08:38,696
Peter was very happy that Heidi came to him all by herself.

76
00:08:38,696 --> 00:08:40,896
Not because he was hungry, as Heidi said.

77
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:42,096
He liked her.

78
00:08:42,096 --> 00:08:45,796
For him, Heidi was something different than the boys and girls from the village.

79
00:08:45,796 --> 00:08:49,696
She shared her love for the animals, the mountains and the flowers.

80
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:53,296
For him, Heidi had become a friend that he didn't want to lose anymore.

81
00:08:54,096 --> 00:08:56,496
If only I could fly with you.

82
00:08:56,496 --> 00:08:57,896
Flying must be beautiful.

83
00:09:01,596 --> 00:09:03,596
Also Heidi liked Peter.

84
00:09:03,637 --> 00:09:06,437
And she was happy that he finally spoke to her again.

85
00:09:06,437 --> 00:09:10,437
She had never understood that Peter was jealous of her little bird.

86
00:09:10,437 --> 00:09:12,437
Jealousy and envy were foreign to her.

87
00:09:12,437 --> 00:09:17,437
She also felt much too comfortable with her grandfather in the mountains to
think about it.

88
00:09:17,437 --> 00:09:21,437
Heidi was very, very happy for the first time in her life.

89
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:39,799
And I taught it to him all by myself.

90
00:11:06,527 --> 00:11:09,527
Or bees, or mice, or something like that.

91
00:11:10,527 --> 00:11:12,527
I have two feathers.

92
00:11:15,527 --> 00:11:16,527
Eat, Fick.

93
00:11:17,527 --> 00:11:18,527
Dear Peter.

94
00:11:20,527 --> 00:11:23,527
You chased him away. Without you, Peep would have been caught.

95
00:11:27,527 --> 00:11:29,527
Oh, your stomach is growling.

96
00:11:30,527 --> 00:11:34,527
That's no wonder, isn't it? With all the excitement.

97
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,181
Why don't you think about it?

98
00:11:36,181 --> 00:11:38,181
I'm always thinking about food!

99
00:11:38,181 --> 00:11:40,181
I'm always thinking about food!

100
00:11:40,181 --> 00:11:41,035
Heinz!

101
00:11:44,191 --> 00:11:46,191
I want to tell you one of the three things! 我想告诉你三件事!

102
00:11:46,191 --> 00:11:48,191
I say water, I'm thirsty! 我说水,我肚子疼!

103
00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:54,191
Can you tell me how she taught you to fly when she doesn't even know the
simplest rules of the game? 你能告诉我她教你飞机的技巧吗?

104
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:57,191
Do you even know that you're a kid? 你知道你小孩吗?

105
00:11:57,191 --> 00:12:00,191
Then let's run around the bed! I know the rules of the game! 让我们跑到游戏中!
我知道这些游戏的规则!

106
00:12:31,894 --> 00:12:33,894
I know the rules of the game!

107
00:12:33,894 --> 00:12:35,894
I know the rules of the game!

108
00:12:55,382 --> 00:12:57,382
Kids can't just get lost in the air!

109
00:12:57,382 --> 00:12:59,382
Maybe there's a mountain ghost here!

110
00:13:13,174 --> 00:13:22,914
Peter made big accusations. He had been distracted by the first real flight of
the little bird and did not pay attention to his herd of goats.

111
00:13:39,798 --> 00:13:43,798
Unfortunately, we have to go over there. Hopefully, you are not dizzy at all.

112
00:13:43,798 --> 00:13:46,798
If you can do that, I can do that too.

113
00:13:46,798 --> 00:13:47,798
Be careful, okay?

114
00:13:47,798 --> 00:13:48,798
Of course!

115
00:13:58,774 --> 00:14:02,754
Now it's going to get foggy. Come on, quick! - Slowly!

116
00:14:14,838 --> 00:14:18,158
I don't like it at all. The fog is getting denser.

117
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:50,710
We should go home and get Grandfather. Maybe he can help.

118
00:14:58,646 --> 00:15:00,646
Did you hear any noise?

119
00:15:00,646 --> 00:15:02,646
No, nothing.

120
00:15:04,646 --> 00:15:06,646
Where are you going now?

121
00:15:06,646 --> 00:15:08,646
Can't you shut up for a moment?

122
00:15:08,646 --> 00:15:10,646
But why?

123
00:15:29,549 --> 00:15:31,549
I was so scared.

124
00:15:35,549 --> 00:15:36,549
What is that?

125
00:15:36,549 --> 00:15:39,549
Those are your bells. You have to be very close.

126
00:15:39,549 --> 00:15:41,549
I think we've finally found them.

127
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:42,549
Really?

128
00:16:01,389 --> 00:16:05,389
Please don't run away again. Please don't run away again. I was so scared of
you.

129
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,637
I dropped a Stone of March.

130
00:16:12,637 --> 00:16:14,637
I can imagine that.

131
00:16:14,637 --> 00:16:17,637
And of course you have no idea how we were trembling around you.

132
00:16:17,637 --> 00:16:20,637
You just run away and stick salt from the rocks.

133
00:16:22,637 --> 00:16:24,637
Oh no, not that either.

134
00:16:28,637 --> 00:16:30,637
Is something wrong?

135
00:16:30,637 --> 00:16:32,637
Either we got lost or the transition is gone.

136
00:16:32,637 --> 00:16:34,637
That's no wonder with the fog.

137
00:16:35,219 --> 00:16:39,019
- Maybe we have to go that way. - Maybe, maybe not. I don't know myself either.

138
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:42,819
But you don't know yourself anywhere else. How are we supposed to find our way
home now?

139
00:16:42,819 --> 00:16:45,619
Maybe we'll find our way when we go the other way.

140
00:16:45,619 --> 00:16:49,619
There's nothing else left for us, but there could be fields everywhere.

141
00:16:49,619 --> 00:16:52,819
- Watch out where you're going. - Let's wait, Peter.

142
00:16:52,819 --> 00:16:54,819
I think you're right.

143
00:17:08,557 --> 00:17:10,557
At least the herd is safe here.

144
00:17:12,557 --> 00:17:14,557
And this morning the sun shone so beautifully.

145
00:17:14,557 --> 00:17:17,557
That's normal, Sonnenbergen. The weather changes quickly here.

146
00:17:29,037 --> 00:17:32,037
We have no reason at all to be happy.

147
00:17:34,037 --> 00:17:35,037
There's someone!

148
00:17:37,037 --> 00:17:38,037
That's...

149
00:17:38,037 --> 00:17:40,857
That can only be Joseph! That's how Joseph sounds!

150
00:18:09,252 --> 00:18:13,252
Yeah, we're in a hurry, but we don't have four legs like you do!

151
00:18:20,484 --> 00:18:23,484
And I couldn't stand him in the beginning because he's so big!

152
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:32,292
There are the stones and the goats are still there!

153
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,100
I thought I'd have to look for the right one.

154
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:48,100
We got lost! I'm so glad you're here, I was so terribly scared!

155
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,100
It's all right, my child.

156
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,100
I always thought you were more sensible.

157
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,100
Why in the world would you have to climb around in the fog?

158
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:07,100
It was the goat's fault, they ran away and we had to look for them, didn't we?

159
00:19:07,962 --> 00:19:12,962
And besides, a stupid falcon would have eaten my bird for one hare.

160
00:19:12,962 --> 00:19:15,962
That seems to have been an exciting day.

161
00:19:15,962 --> 00:19:22,962
If Peter hadn't been there, then Piep wouldn't be alive now and we wouldn't have
found the goats either.

162
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:29,962
I see, I understand. And as far as I know Peter, he doesn't have anything other
than a bear's hunger at the moment.

163
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:35,962
Not only Peter, me too. Did you notice that we haven't eaten anything today?

164
00:19:37,786 --> 00:19:38,786
Yes.

165
00:19:39,786 --> 00:19:41,786
Why are you still waiting?

166
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:07,700
Now I'm so old and I've never seen anyone eat so much in such a short time.

167
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,700
I'll at least pat your back so you don't choke.

168
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,700
Peter eats at least twice as fast as he thinks.

169
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,700
What?

170
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,700
She has no right to say something like that about me.

171
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,700
I'm just sometimes a bit forgetful.

172
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,700
Like today, for example.

173
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,546
Today?

174
00:20:31,546 --> 00:20:33,546
I've forgotten the letter.

175
00:20:34,546 --> 00:20:36,546
And this one?

176
00:20:38,546 --> 00:20:40,546
Thank you, Peter. I hope you like it.

177
00:21:02,907 --> 00:21:07,907
Sleep well, Joseph. Good night. Good night, Grandfather. And thank you very
much.

178
00:21:07,907 --> 00:21:10,907
Good night, my child. And let's dream tonight of something that will be fun.

179
00:21:10,907 --> 00:21:13,907
Yes, I will try my best. Sleep well.

180
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:30,299
I have found a very good position in Frankfurt.

181
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:32,299
The city is big and exciting.

182
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:35,299
I experience something new every day.

183
00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:38,299
If only Heidi could go to school here.

184
00:21:48,443 --> 00:21:50,443
Why aren't you asleep yet?

185
00:21:53,443 --> 00:21:55,443
What's wrong with you?

186
00:21:55,443 --> 00:21:59,443
It's so, so, so, so beautiful when you have a grandfather.

187
00:22:01,443 --> 00:22:03,443
This child.

188
00:22:15,643 --> 00:22:25,643
In the few days she spent with him, she became such an essential part of his
life that he didn't want to know anything about letters he wrote from the city,
as she wrote to Dieter.

189
00:22:25,643 --> 00:22:34,643
He loved the little girl so much that he couldn't imagine a life without the
child.

190
00:22:53,723 --> 00:22:58,403
Heidi didn't know anything about what her grandfather was doing.

191
00:22:58,403 --> 00:23:05,243
She brought the goats to the pasture with Peter day after day and discovered
something new every time.

192
00:23:05,243 --> 00:23:09,243
Everything was full of excitement and adventure for her.

193
00:23:09,243 --> 00:23:14,443
She had no idea about any letters or secret plans of her aunt Dete.

194
00:23:14,443 --> 00:23:17,003
She certainly wouldn't have taken her seriously.

195
00:23:17,003 --> 00:23:22,283
For Heidi it was obvious that she wanted to stay up here in the mountains
forever.

196
00:23:22,385 --> 00:23:26,385
But we'll tell you about that in our next story.
