00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Heide

00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Heide

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Heide

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Heide

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Heide

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Heide

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Heide

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Heide

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Heide

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Heide

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Heide

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Heide

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Heide

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Heide

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Heide

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Heide

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Heide

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Heide

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Come home

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Find your happiness

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Come back home

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Find your happiness

23
00:01:26,074 --> 00:01:28,074
Careful, I'll hold you.

24
00:01:28,074 --> 00:01:30,074
We did it, Clara.

25
00:01:30,074 --> 00:01:32,074
We did it.

26
00:01:32,074 --> 00:01:34,074
But maybe it's just a dream.

27
00:01:34,074 --> 00:01:36,074
No!

28
00:01:50,234 --> 00:01:54,234
We have to write a letter now and tell it to grandfather.

29
00:01:54,234 --> 00:01:56,234
Yes, do it.

30
00:01:57,234 --> 00:02:00,234
Oh, you're even standing free-handed. Grandfather!

31
00:02:01,234 --> 00:02:04,234
Grandfather, come with me quickly. I want to show you something. Come quickly.

32
00:02:04,234 --> 00:02:06,234
Grandfather, quickly!

33
00:02:06,234 --> 00:02:07,234
There!

34
00:02:07,234 --> 00:02:08,234
Clara.

35
00:02:08,234 --> 00:02:10,234
Clara is standing free-handed.

36
00:02:10,234 --> 00:02:10,810
Just run!

37
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,810
I can't believe it.

38
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,810
I'm so happy.

39
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,810
You would never have thought that.

40
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,810
I can't believe it.

41
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,810
I don't know what to say.

42
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,810
I'm proud of you, Clara.

43
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,810
I'm very proud of you.

44
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,810
And thank you very much.

45
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,810
No, my child.

46
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,810
You're not to be thanked.

47
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,810
You made it all by yourself.

48
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,810
No, not yet.

49
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:34,848
Let me stay here a little longer.

50
00:02:34,848 --> 00:02:38,648
I want to try for a while to see if it really works. I don't believe it yet.

51
00:02:38,648 --> 00:02:41,648
I'm afraid that I'll never be able to do it again when I sit down.

52
00:02:42,648 --> 00:02:47,048
You can forget this fear. You've only been able to do it once and will be able
to do it again and again.

53
00:02:47,048 --> 00:02:49,848
Hopefully. Hopefully you're right.

54
00:02:49,848 --> 00:02:54,148
It's just that everything looks so different. It's so unusual and strange.

55
00:02:54,148 --> 00:02:55,648
It looks much bigger.

56
00:02:55,648 --> 00:02:58,748
I don't dare to look down at the earth at all.

57
00:02:58,748 --> 00:03:00,648
The ground is suddenly very far away.

58
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:04,648
Strange. For me, it's very close.

59
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,140
Now I'm curious what he's going to say.

60
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,140
We'll get him now.

61
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,140
Hello!

62
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,140
Hello Peter! Good evening!

63
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,140
Good evening!

64
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,140
How are you, Clara?

65
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,372
Have you made any progress?

66
00:03:28,372 --> 00:03:30,372
No, Peter, I'm sorry.

67
00:03:30,372 --> 00:03:32,372
Unfortunately not yet.

68
00:03:35,372 --> 00:03:37,372
Why is she whining like that?

69
00:03:37,372 --> 00:03:39,372
Keep practicing, okay?

70
00:03:43,372 --> 00:03:44,372
She's crazy.

71
00:03:46,372 --> 00:03:48,372
Well, now it's time.

72
00:03:48,372 --> 00:03:49,372
Yes.

73
00:03:52,372 --> 00:03:53,372
Peter!

74
00:03:53,508 --> 00:03:57,508
Man, oh man!

75
00:04:06,116 --> 00:04:08,116
There's no way that can't be true.

76
00:04:08,116 --> 00:04:09,116
You're amazed?

77
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:10,116
Yes.

78
00:04:13,116 --> 00:04:16,116
Calm down, stop screaming!

79
00:04:24,116 --> 00:04:26,084
Clara, I'm sorry!

80
00:04:26,084 --> 00:04:28,084
I think I have to sit for a moment.

81
00:04:28,084 --> 00:04:30,084
Yes, I can understand that.

82
00:04:33,084 --> 00:04:35,084
So, I sit. Thank you.

83
00:04:35,084 --> 00:04:37,084
You look like you still couldn't believe it.

84
00:04:37,084 --> 00:04:39,084
I can't somehow.

85
00:04:39,084 --> 00:04:40,084
Peter!

86
00:04:40,084 --> 00:04:41,084
Huh?

87
00:04:41,084 --> 00:04:45,084
If you don't hurry up soon, your goats will arrive in the village without you.

88
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:46,084
Oh dear.

89
00:04:46,084 --> 00:04:47,084
Goodbye, see you tomorrow!

90
00:04:47,084 --> 00:04:48,084
Goodbye!

91
00:04:48,084 --> 00:04:50,084
Do you want to stay here?

92
00:04:51,084 --> 00:04:54,084
Come tomorrow, not so late!

93
00:04:56,084 --> 00:04:58,084
See you tomorrow!

94
00:05:01,764 --> 00:05:10,584
It's a pity that I can't see Grandmother's face when she reads the letter.

95
00:05:10,596 --> 00:05:14,596
So either she cries for joy or she laughs and dances through the room.

96
00:05:14,596 --> 00:05:17,596
I think she doesn't do anything and is speechless for the time being.

97
00:05:17,596 --> 00:05:22,596
Oh, what? Grandmother and speechless? Never in life. That doesn't suit her. I
think she dances.

98
00:05:22,596 --> 00:05:23,596
Well, maybe you're right.

99
00:05:23,596 --> 00:05:29,596
Or wait a minute. We don't write that I can stand. I want to be able to walk
first and then we say it.

100
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:31,596
What? Can we do that?

101
00:05:31,596 --> 00:05:34,596
And then we both surprise. Papa and you.

102
00:05:34,596 --> 00:05:35,596
Oh, what?

103
00:05:35,596 --> 00:05:39,596
Yes, Heidi. I want to see your faces when you find out.

104
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,706
That's going to be nice.

105
00:05:58,414 --> 00:06:03,414
Right foot, left foot, right foot, slowly.

106
00:06:03,414 --> 00:06:08,414
And right, left, right, left.

107
00:06:08,414 --> 00:06:11,414
Nice and even, don't get tired.

108
00:06:14,414 --> 00:06:16,270
Good morning!

109
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:19,270
Good morning, look what we're doing here tomorrow.

110
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:23,270
Do you know roughly when she can go to the alleys?

111
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:27,270
That will take some time, but please do me a favor and let me go for a moment.

112
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:30,270
Gladly. You have exactly the right size.

113
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:33,270
That even works better than with me.

114
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:43,270
One and two and three and right and left and right and far.

115
00:06:46,270 --> 00:07:03,270
One, two, one, two.

116
00:07:03,694 --> 00:07:05,694
It's getting better from time to time.

117
00:07:05,694 --> 00:07:07,694
It won't hurt anymore, will it?

118
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:10,694
So you don't want to give up, you two?

119
00:07:10,694 --> 00:07:11,694
You're exaggerating.

120
00:07:11,694 --> 00:07:13,694
It's way too exhausting what you're doing.

121
00:07:13,694 --> 00:07:14,694
No, not at all.

122
00:07:14,694 --> 00:07:15,694
Really not.

123
00:07:15,694 --> 00:07:16,694
I'm not tired at all.

124
00:07:16,694 --> 00:07:17,694
Really not.

125
00:07:28,974 --> 00:07:32,374
Nice and even, nice and far.

126
00:07:32,374 --> 00:07:41,374
Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

127
00:07:41,874 --> 00:07:43,674
What? It's early again?

128
00:07:45,774 --> 00:07:47,374
What are you doing?

129
00:07:48,474 --> 00:07:49,374
Just like that.

130
00:07:49,374 --> 00:07:50,574
You're already here?

131
00:07:51,716 --> 00:07:53,716
It's her fault. She ran away from me.

132
00:07:53,716 --> 00:07:56,716
Of course I had to follow her and catch her.

133
00:07:56,716 --> 00:07:58,716
You're lying!

134
00:07:58,716 --> 00:08:00,716
Listen, you're just curious.

135
00:08:00,716 --> 00:08:02,716
Me? Curious? No.

136
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:04,716
Yes, curious.

137
00:08:04,716 --> 00:08:06,716
Believe me, he just wants to know what we're doing.

138
00:08:06,716 --> 00:08:08,716
Well, then he should see it.

139
00:08:08,716 --> 00:08:09,716
One.

140
00:08:09,716 --> 00:08:11,716
What are you saying? Without my help.

141
00:08:11,716 --> 00:08:14,716
Fabulous, Clara. I would never have thought that.

142
00:08:15,236 --> 00:08:16,036
Yes?

143
00:08:16,036 --> 00:08:18,036
Are you leaving the goats alone again?

144
00:08:18,036 --> 00:08:20,836
Please don't scold him, Grandfather. He can't do anything about it.

145
00:08:20,836 --> 00:08:22,036
He has to see it.

146
00:08:22,036 --> 00:08:22,536
Hm?

147
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:23,336
Yes.

148
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:27,536
Peter, I understand your impatience, but the herd is more important. So go.

149
00:08:27,536 --> 00:08:28,036
Yes.

150
00:08:28,036 --> 00:08:28,536
Run!

151
00:08:28,536 --> 00:08:29,036
Stupid.

152
00:08:29,036 --> 00:08:30,536
Swinley and Geisel have to have herbs.

153
00:08:30,536 --> 00:08:31,536
Leave me alone!

154
00:08:31,536 --> 00:08:34,536
Don't give up, Clara. I'll be back tonight.

155
00:08:34,536 --> 00:08:37,036
Don't worry. I'll never give up.

156
00:08:41,036 --> 00:08:43,036
I don't understand. She should...

157
00:08:43,118 --> 00:08:49,118
It's been weeks since I last saw her with my own eyes.

158
00:08:52,118 --> 00:08:55,118
She can walk. She showed it.

159
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:05,416
Today I'll write it.

160
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,416
Grandmother doesn't think you can't walk.

161
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,416
Of course not. I can't walk yet.

162
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,416
And the bar doesn't count.

163
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,416
What am I supposed to write then?

164
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,416
Why don't you write,

165
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:19,416
Clara tries every day, but she can't walk yet?

166
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,416
No, it's enough for me.

167
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,416
I'm slowly getting it done.

168
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,416
Just do it. The surprise gets bigger and bigger afterwards.

169
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,416
So good.

170
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,416
I'll write that you like to practice every day

171
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,416
and laugh at it.

172
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:33,432
Good luck.

173
00:09:33,432 --> 00:09:37,432
She never believes that. She never believes that I laugh while practicing.

174
00:09:37,432 --> 00:09:39,432
And why not?

175
00:09:41,432 --> 00:09:46,432
So tell me, can't we write that we threw the wheelchair away because the wheels
were stuck?

176
00:09:46,432 --> 00:09:48,432
Ah, does she believe that?

177
00:09:48,432 --> 00:09:50,432
Yes, I can imagine that she believes that.

178
00:09:50,432 --> 00:09:54,432
We can write that he was standing in the rain and is now completely rusty.

179
00:09:54,432 --> 00:09:56,432
It could have been a thunderstorm.

180
00:09:56,432 --> 00:09:58,334
Do you know what amazes me?

181
00:09:58,334 --> 00:10:00,334
That you're not even red yet.

182
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:05,334
If I had to look at her, I might be red, but the ink can't change, can it?

183
00:10:05,334 --> 00:10:07,334
I don't think I'm writing anything.

184
00:10:11,334 --> 00:10:15,334
She won't take that off your wheelchair. She knows I can repair it.

185
00:10:16,334 --> 00:10:19,334
Well, then I'll just write that the wheelchair was rusted.

186
00:10:28,334 --> 00:10:29,592
To be continued...

187
00:10:29,592 --> 00:10:36,592
We're not going to throw the wheelchair away right away, we're just going to
hide it.

188
00:10:36,592 --> 00:10:39,592
Yes, good.

189
00:10:42,592 --> 00:10:45,592
Doesn't it matter to you that he's gone all of a sudden?

190
00:10:45,592 --> 00:10:48,592
No, it's kind of weird, isn't it?

191
00:10:54,592 --> 00:10:55,896
Very nice.

192
00:10:55,896 --> 00:10:58,896
Slowly. Then nothing can happen.

193
00:10:59,896 --> 00:11:04,896
One. Two. Slowly.

194
00:11:05,896 --> 00:11:07,896
Left.

195
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:16,088
Up to here and all the way to the end.

196
00:11:16,088 --> 00:11:19,088
I won't be able to do it anymore.

197
00:11:19,088 --> 00:11:21,088
You could do it because we hid the wheelchair.

198
00:11:21,088 --> 00:11:23,088
It looks like it.

199
00:11:23,088 --> 00:11:25,088
Come on, Heidi.

200
00:11:32,088 --> 00:11:34,088
Good morning, Clara. Good morning, Heidi.

201
00:11:34,088 --> 00:11:36,088
Look, it's still working.

202
00:11:36,088 --> 00:11:37,496
Oh, my God.

203
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:39,496
I even hid the wheelchair in the shed this morning.

204
00:11:39,496 --> 00:11:41,496
Good thing the old thing is gone.

205
00:11:41,496 --> 00:11:42,496
I think so too.

206
00:11:42,496 --> 00:11:43,496
Well then, see you at work today!

207
00:11:43,496 --> 00:11:45,496
Goodbye, don't be so late!

208
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,760
Good, you can do it.

209
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,760
Yes, let my hand go now, Heidi.

210
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,760
Yes.

211
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,760
I don't know, I think I can do it alone.

212
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,760
Do you think so?

213
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,760
Yes, let's go.

214
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,760
Clara, be careful!

215
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,760
I'm probably not that far yet.

216
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,760
Too bad, I thought it was possible.

217
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,760
Oh, what's wrong?

218
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,760
It was too early.

219
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,760
Unfortunately.

220
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,760
Is there milk?

221
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,760
Of course, I'll get it for you.

222
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,760
Wait, okay?

223
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,760
I'll get it for you.

224
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,498
Heidi, quick!

225
00:12:54,498 --> 00:12:58,498
Come on, hurry up! I can't hold on any longer!

226
00:13:07,498 --> 00:13:08,498
No!

227
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:10,498
This is...

228
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,498
Stop!

229
00:13:11,498 --> 00:13:12,498
Help!

230
00:13:13,498 --> 00:13:15,498
It's so dizzying!

231
00:13:20,498 --> 00:13:21,498
Oh dear, Clara!

232
00:13:21,498 --> 00:13:23,498
Grandfather, quick!

233
00:13:23,498 --> 00:13:24,162
Stop!

234
00:13:24,162 --> 00:13:26,162
Just say something, Clara!

235
00:13:29,162 --> 00:13:32,162
Now all that's missing is that you broke a leg.

236
00:13:33,162 --> 00:13:35,162
Tell me, does it hurt more than usual?

237
00:13:35,162 --> 00:13:37,162
Clara, what happened?

238
00:13:37,162 --> 00:13:39,162
Do you feel pain?

239
00:13:41,162 --> 00:13:43,162
Now tell me, what is it?

240
00:13:47,162 --> 00:13:49,162
Come to me.

241
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,262
I'm scared.

242
00:13:51,262 --> 00:13:52,762
Why scared?

243
00:13:52,762 --> 00:13:57,762
I wonder too. When I went to get milk, she was at the fence. She must have
walked all the way alone.

244
00:13:57,762 --> 00:14:00,762
Yes, that's right.

245
00:14:00,762 --> 00:14:04,762
Yes, but then you don't have to be scared anymore.

246
00:14:04,762 --> 00:14:07,762
Congratulations, Clara.

247
00:14:07,762 --> 00:14:09,762
You probably don't want to hear that.

248
00:14:09,762 --> 00:14:12,762
I think Clara got scared because she fell down.

249
00:14:12,762 --> 00:14:14,262
What now?

250
00:14:14,262 --> 00:14:16,762
For today you have practiced enough. We don't want to overdo it.

251
00:14:16,762 --> 00:14:17,762
Good.

252
00:14:17,762 --> 00:14:18,762
Then come.

253
00:14:19,762 --> 00:14:20,762
Yes.

254
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:34,490
You two stay in the living room in this nice weather.

255
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,490
Isn't that good for you, Clara?

256
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:39,490
She doesn't feel like going out today.

257
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:59,026
Grandfather, will you please bring me up? I would like to sleep. I'm so terribly
tired.

258
00:14:59,026 --> 00:15:01,026
As you wish.

259
00:15:08,588 --> 00:15:10,588
Now sleep well, my little one.

260
00:15:10,588 --> 00:15:12,588
Yes, I will.

261
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,300
It tasted good, as always.

262
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,300
It can't have tasted good. You didn't drink anything.

263
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:40,300
I don't like today. I didn't practice today, so I can't be hungry.

264
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,080
I don't like today. I didn't practice today. I can't be hungry.

265
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,080
I don't like today. I can't be hungry.

266
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,080
I don't like today. I can't be hungry.

267
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,080
I don't like today. I can't be hungry.

268
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,080
Just a bit more.

269
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,080
Then its all finished.

270
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,270
She's strange.

271
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,270
It was going so well.

272
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,270
She doesn't feel like it anymore.

273
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,270
Well, well.

274
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,270
Clara needs a few days of rest.

275
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,270
Leave her alone.

276
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,270
She has to sit down for a while.

277
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,270
Still, I find it strange.

278
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,270
Because you, as always,

279
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:37,270
want to achieve everything from today to tomorrow.

280
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:39,270
Heidi,

281
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:41,270
let her go. Please.

282
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,270
No!

283
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,270
No!

284
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,270
No!

285
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:55,270
No!

286
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,270
No!

287
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,270
No!

288
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,550
No!

289
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,550
No, what am I going to do now?

290
00:19:16,694 --> 00:19:17,694
What was that?

291
00:19:17,694 --> 00:19:18,694
Clara!

292
00:19:19,694 --> 00:19:20,694
Oh dear.

293
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,694
What are you doing there?

294
00:19:26,694 --> 00:19:28,694
You ran all the way there!

295
00:19:33,694 --> 00:19:35,694
Clara, please stop crying.

296
00:19:35,694 --> 00:19:36,694
Please, Clara.

297
00:19:36,694 --> 00:19:37,694
You have no reason.

298
00:19:37,694 --> 00:19:39,694
You ran all the way there.

299
00:19:42,198 --> 00:19:45,198
Do you understand why she's crying?

300
00:19:48,198 --> 00:19:49,198
Clara, what is it?

301
00:19:49,198 --> 00:19:50,198
I broke it!

302
00:19:50,198 --> 00:19:52,198
I knocked the wheelchair down!

303
00:19:52,198 --> 00:19:53,198
Clara, stop it!

304
00:19:53,198 --> 00:19:55,198
Now it's all over!

305
00:19:55,198 --> 00:19:56,502
Nothing is over.

306
00:19:56,502 --> 00:20:02,502
Now everything starts right. Don't cry. I know what you think. I know what's
going on in you.

307
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:06,502
I think you wish at the moment everything would have stayed the way it was.

308
00:20:06,502 --> 00:20:10,502
You just got a little discouraged. That's over.

309
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:14,502
Watch out. If we've overcome that, everything will go much faster.

310
00:20:15,502 --> 00:20:17,502
I always do everything wrong.

311
00:20:26,502 --> 00:20:30,502

312
00:20:38,102 --> 00:20:40,402
And they didn't know that this morning?

313
00:20:40,402 --> 00:20:42,602
Why are you standing there all wrinkled?

314
00:20:43,602 --> 00:20:45,102
Here, make yourself comfortable

315
00:20:46,402 --> 00:20:47,602
Are you on vacation today?

316
00:20:47,602 --> 00:20:48,602
Something like that

317
00:20:50,502 --> 00:20:52,602
Look, the eagle is in the sky

318
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,840
Do you want to help me?

319
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,840
Yes.

320
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,840
Heidi, you too.

321
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,840
Yes, of course.

322
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,840
Now you walk up here for the first time.

323
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,840
Attention.

324
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,840
Ready.

325
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,840
Everything seems much bigger to me.

326
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,840
The mountains are much higher than usual.

327
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:27,840
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

328
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,918
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

329
00:21:28,918 --> 00:21:34,918
Six, seven, eight, oh, look at that. 六,七,八,哦,看看吧。

330
00:21:50,918 --> 00:21:53,918
Careful. 小心。

331
00:21:53,918 --> 00:21:59,918
Be careful not to stand still. 小心。

332
00:22:01,248 --> 00:22:03,248
Slowly.

333
00:22:03,248 --> 00:22:05,248
Right.

334
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,248
You made it!

335
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:29,240
I picked it up. I ran over and picked it up. Now I can write to Grandmother.

336
00:22:48,384 --> 00:22:56,384
Finally it was time. Heidi and Clara wrote to the grandmother that she should
come and the grandmother immediately announced her arrival.

337
00:22:56,384 --> 00:23:02,384
But she was not alone to the great joy of the children. Clara's father, Mr.
Sesemann, came with her.

338
00:23:02,384 --> 00:23:08,384
And so much Clara's surprise exactly as she had often imagined it.

339
00:23:08,384 --> 00:23:13,384
But unfortunately it was also said to say goodbye at the same time. The
beautiful summer was over.

340
00:23:13,384 --> 00:23:17,384
The carriage was about to bring Clara home.

341
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:21,670
Even Peter had to swallow a few times not to burst into tears.

342
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:25,670
But we want to tell you about that in our next story.

343
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:54,572
Heide, Heide, your world are the mountains, Heide, Heide, because up here you
are at home, Heide, Heide, come home, find your happiness, come back again.

344
