1
00:00:02,438 --> 00:00:17,438
Holadio

2
00:00:20,438 --> 00:00:24,438
Heidi

3
00:00:24,438 --> 00:00:28,438
Your world are the mountains

4
00:00:28,438 --> 00:00:32,438
Heidi

5
00:00:32,438 --> 00:00:36,438
Because up here you are at home

6
00:00:36,438 --> 00:00:40,438
Dark pines

7
00:00:40,438 --> 00:00:44,438
Green meadows in the sunshine

8
00:00:44,438 --> 00:00:48,438
Heidi, Heidi

9
00:00:48,438 --> 00:00:52,438
You need to be happy

10
00:00:52,438 --> 00:01:01,438
Holadio

11
00:01:01,438 --> 00:01:05,438
Holadio

12
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,438
Heidi, Heidi

13
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:11,438
Come home

14
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:13,438
Find your happiness

15
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:18,438
Come back home

16
00:01:26,042 --> 00:01:29,042
I thought Grandma was coming for breakfast.

17
00:01:29,042 --> 00:01:31,042
It's way too early.

18
00:01:31,042 --> 00:01:33,042
She has to go to sleep.

19
00:01:33,042 --> 00:01:35,042
She should sleep at home.

20
00:01:35,042 --> 00:01:36,042
Clara!

21
00:01:36,042 --> 00:01:38,042
Tell me when she comes.

22
00:01:39,042 --> 00:01:41,042
No, don't tell her.

23
00:01:41,042 --> 00:01:43,042
Heidi, Clara, go and wash.

24
00:01:43,042 --> 00:01:46,042
And then come for breakfast. It's all done.

25
00:01:46,042 --> 00:01:48,042
Yes!

26
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:50,042
Heidi!

27
00:01:56,042 --> 00:01:59,042
Mrs. Sesemann, it's time!

28
00:02:00,042 --> 00:02:02,042
Has anyone else come yet?

29
00:02:12,042 --> 00:02:13,042
Huh?

30
00:02:13,042 --> 00:02:14,042
Ouch!

31
00:02:18,042 --> 00:02:20,042
Take good care of Clara, please.

32
00:02:20,042 --> 00:02:22,042
Don't worry about it.

33
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:25,042
But please take care of the house in Frankfurt.

34
00:02:25,042 --> 00:02:27,042
Of course.

35
00:02:27,042 --> 00:02:31,042
I have planned to stay here longer than planned.

36
00:02:31,042 --> 00:02:34,042
And please, Clara has to do her homework every day.

37
00:02:34,042 --> 00:02:36,042
Otherwise she will forget what she learned.

38
00:02:36,042 --> 00:02:38,042
I know. You have to hurry.

39
00:02:38,042 --> 00:02:40,042
Otherwise you will miss the train.

40
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:50,042
I have to go.

41
00:02:55,194 --> 00:02:59,194
Goodbye, Mrs. Sesemann, and please greet Mrs. Enklara from me again.

42
00:02:59,194 --> 00:03:01,194
Yes, gladly.

43
00:03:05,802 --> 00:03:07,802
Fräulein Rottenmeier is gone.

44
00:03:11,802 --> 00:03:13,802
Look, another Peter.

45
00:03:14,802 --> 00:03:15,802
Good morning.

46
00:03:16,802 --> 00:03:18,802
Good morning, but why are you hiding?

47
00:03:18,802 --> 00:03:19,802
I want to get her.

48
00:03:19,802 --> 00:03:22,802
Oh yes, but unfortunately I can not come with you right away.

49
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,802
I have decided to go shopping before.

50
00:03:26,128 --> 00:03:30,728
Please be so kind and tell the two girls that I will come back later.

51
00:03:30,728 --> 00:03:35,128
I was so tired last night that I fell asleep without doing anything.

52
00:03:35,128 --> 00:03:37,128
I'd love that!

53
00:03:42,128 --> 00:03:45,128
That's how fast you should be able to be again.

54
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:52,128
Good morning! Good morning!

55
00:03:52,522 --> 00:03:54,022
Why are you alone?

56
00:03:54,022 --> 00:03:55,022
Where is the grandmother?

57
00:03:55,022 --> 00:03:57,022
Did you notice if Mrs. Rottenmeier is gone?

58
00:03:57,022 --> 00:03:57,522
Hm?

59
00:03:57,522 --> 00:03:58,522
What first?

60
00:03:58,522 --> 00:03:59,522
Why?

61
00:04:00,522 --> 00:04:02,522
Which question should I answer first?

62
00:04:02,522 --> 00:04:04,022
I don't know what you mean.

63
00:04:04,022 --> 00:04:04,522
Me too.

64
00:04:04,522 --> 00:04:07,022
We asked three questions in a row earlier.

65
00:04:07,022 --> 00:04:08,522
Ask one after the other.

66
00:04:08,522 --> 00:04:11,022
Oh, what? You know what we want to know.

67
00:04:11,022 --> 00:04:12,022
Good.

68
00:04:12,022 --> 00:04:14,522
One has left and the other is going shopping.

69
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,522
Hopefully not more knives.

70
00:04:17,522 --> 00:04:19,022
I don't know what to start with.

71
00:04:19,022 --> 00:04:20,022
Me too.

72
00:04:20,512 --> 00:04:23,012
Did she tell you what she wants to buy?

73
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,012
No.

74
00:04:24,012 --> 00:04:28,012
Too bad, she's probably buying presents for us and I'd like to know what.

75
00:04:28,012 --> 00:04:29,012
I think so. See you soon!

76
00:04:29,012 --> 00:04:30,012
See you tonight!

77
00:04:30,012 --> 00:04:31,512
See you!

78
00:04:31,512 --> 00:04:34,512
If I get a present too, please pick it up for me.

79
00:04:34,512 --> 00:04:36,012
See you!

80
00:04:36,842 --> 00:04:39,842
He already got the knife from her yesterday.

81
00:04:47,082 --> 00:04:49,082
What a romantic little hut!

82
00:04:49,082 --> 00:04:52,082
Do people live here or is it just for the holidays?

83
00:04:52,082 --> 00:04:53,082
Peter lives here.

84
00:04:53,082 --> 00:04:55,082
The boy lives here?

85
00:04:55,082 --> 00:04:57,082
Please take me there, I want to say good day.

86
00:04:57,082 --> 00:04:59,082
You are always so nice to Heidi and Clara.

87
00:04:59,082 --> 00:05:00,082
Yes, well.

88
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,458
What a beautiful work.

89
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,458
I am glad to meet you.

90
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,458
Heidi has told a lot about you.

91
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,458
And Clara has described you in letters.

92
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:14,458
I am glad too.

93
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,458
And I would like to use the opportunity to thank you

94
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:19,458
that you were so nice to our Heidi in Frankfurt.

95
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:21,458
That's why you don't have to thank me.

96
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,458
That was a matter of course.

97
00:05:23,952 --> 00:05:28,952
Heidi is a lovely girl. You can't imagine how happy she made me.

98
00:05:28,952 --> 00:05:32,952
We sometimes laughed together. We could play together wonderfully.

99
00:05:32,952 --> 00:05:36,952
I'm just sorry I understood too late how much she wanted to go home.

100
00:05:36,952 --> 00:05:38,952
Oh, that's all long forgotten and hurt.

101
00:05:38,952 --> 00:05:42,952
A child like Heidi could not feel comfortable in the big city.

102
00:05:42,952 --> 00:05:44,952
Heidi needs the mountains.

103
00:05:44,952 --> 00:05:48,952
Yes, now that I've met everything, I know it's too late.

104
00:05:49,168 --> 00:05:53,768
For a long time, I was afraid that they would come one day to get Heidi away
from here.

105
00:05:53,768 --> 00:05:56,768
But God forbid, Heidi promised never to go again.

106
00:06:04,602 --> 00:06:06,602
I think she's coming!

107
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:09,602
Finally!

108
00:06:11,602 --> 00:06:13,602
I couldn't have waited any longer!

109
00:06:17,602 --> 00:06:18,602
Good morning, children!

110
00:06:18,602 --> 00:06:19,602
Good morning!

111
00:06:19,602 --> 00:06:21,602
Where have you been so long? We've been waiting so long!

112
00:06:21,602 --> 00:06:23,602
So? How rude of me!

113
00:06:23,602 --> 00:06:25,602
Please help me down.

114
00:06:25,602 --> 00:06:26,602
Yes.

115
00:06:27,602 --> 00:06:28,602
Thank you very much.

116
00:06:28,602 --> 00:06:30,602
Would you please carry my bag into the hut?

117
00:06:30,602 --> 00:06:32,602
Yes, I'd love to.

118
00:06:32,602 --> 00:06:34,602
There they are!

119
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:35,602
I think so, too.

120
00:06:36,602 --> 00:06:37,562
Oh!

121
00:06:37,562 --> 00:06:41,762
Oh, why can't you just invent more comfortable horses?

122
00:06:41,762 --> 00:06:42,962
Everything hurts me.

123
00:06:42,962 --> 00:06:44,362
I can imagine.

124
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,562
Grandfather?

125
00:06:46,562 --> 00:06:47,862
Good morning.

126
00:06:47,862 --> 00:06:53,762
Would you say it would be shameless if I asked you again for such a wonderful
glass of fresh goat's milk?

127
00:06:53,762 --> 00:06:56,162
Not at all.

128
00:06:56,162 --> 00:06:57,262
I made it.

129
00:06:57,262 --> 00:06:59,362
Well, thank you.

130
00:06:59,362 --> 00:07:00,762
Now finally say it.

131
00:07:00,762 --> 00:07:01,962
What should I say?

132
00:07:01,962 --> 00:07:03,262
What's in the bag.

133
00:07:03,262 --> 00:07:03,962
Come with me.

134
00:07:03,962 --> 00:07:05,856
We'll just take a look.

135
00:07:05,856 --> 00:07:07,856
Good-bye.

136
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,650
Oh, there's nothing better.

137
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,650
Now show it to us, please.

138
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:19,650
What did you buy?

139
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,650
Oh, that's what you mean.

140
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:27,650
A wonderful bedclothes for everyone and a head pillow here.

141
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:31,650
A warm night's dress for Clara, but also wear it.

142
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:35,650
You know, my child, the nights are getting colder again.

143
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:38,650
And then a few work trousers for the palm oil.

144
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,650
So, is that what you want to know?

145
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,650
Is that all?

146
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:43,650
Yes.

147
00:07:43,856 --> 00:07:47,856
We thought you would buy us a present. You also brought something for Peter.

148
00:07:47,856 --> 00:07:49,856
Yes, we thought so.

149
00:07:49,856 --> 00:07:52,856
Well, then I have to buy you something.

150
00:07:52,856 --> 00:07:54,856
Yes, it doesn't have to be anything big and expensive.

151
00:07:54,856 --> 00:07:56,856
Chocolate!

152
00:07:56,856 --> 00:07:59,856
Well, nice. But that's why I'm not going down the mountain right away.

153
00:07:59,856 --> 00:08:01,456
Oh, too bad.

154
00:08:01,456 --> 00:08:05,576
No, certainly not. You can't ask for that. You'll have to wait.

155
00:08:05,576 --> 00:08:07,896
Besides, I'm terribly tired again.

156
00:08:07,896 --> 00:08:09,336
I just don't believe it.

157
00:08:09,336 --> 00:08:13,296
But listen, Clara. You have the whole closet full of toys at home.

158
00:08:13,296 --> 00:08:16,336
What more do you need? Now go and play outside.

159
00:08:17,136 --> 00:08:20,176
I'm sorry, Grandmother, but I still don't believe it.

160
00:08:20,176 --> 00:08:23,736
Well, you torturers, I have a present for you.

161
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:24,432
Grandma!

162
00:08:24,432 --> 00:08:26,432
Show me what you've hidden!

163
00:08:26,432 --> 00:08:28,432
You can't see my present.

164
00:08:28,432 --> 00:08:30,432
Can you give something like that away?

165
00:08:30,432 --> 00:08:32,432
And if you can give something like that away.

166
00:08:32,432 --> 00:08:36,432
How are we supposed to recognize it if you give us something transparent?

167
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:40,432
I don't give you anything transparent, I give you something invisible.

168
00:08:41,432 --> 00:08:45,432
So, and now I don't want to hear anything from you anymore. Wait until tomorrow.

169
00:08:45,432 --> 00:08:47,432
Yes, but just say it.

170
00:08:47,432 --> 00:08:49,344
No, I can't do that.

171
00:08:49,344 --> 00:08:51,844
Let us guess, with hot and cold.

172
00:08:51,844 --> 00:08:55,344
That looks like you. If you don't want to give up, you don't want to give up.

173
00:08:55,344 --> 00:08:57,844
And now you're trying to get me around with all means.

174
00:08:57,844 --> 00:08:58,844
Why not?

175
00:08:58,844 --> 00:09:01,344
Keep going, Heidi. Maybe you can do it.

176
00:09:01,344 --> 00:09:04,344
She already looks like she's about to tell us.

177
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:05,844
I don't think so.

178
00:09:05,844 --> 00:09:07,844
Will you at least go for a walk with us?

179
00:09:07,844 --> 00:09:10,844
No, I'm tired. I want to rest today.

180
00:09:10,844 --> 00:09:12,844
I'm not used to the mountain air yet.

181
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,344
Why don't you go to Peter?

182
00:09:14,344 --> 00:09:16,844
Me? If Clara has nothing against it?

183
00:09:17,184 --> 00:09:19,184
I'd like to go back to the pasture.

184
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:23,184
Besides, I have to make sure that the little ghost gets good herbs.

185
00:09:23,184 --> 00:09:25,184
Don't come back so late.

186
00:09:25,184 --> 00:09:26,184
Say hello to Peter.

187
00:09:26,184 --> 00:09:29,184
Why? I don't understand. Don't the goats eat on their own?

188
00:09:29,184 --> 00:09:33,184
Yes, but she always gives him special herbs so that they give good milk.

189
00:09:33,184 --> 00:09:35,184
Especially for me.

190
00:09:35,184 --> 00:09:39,184
I've always said it. Heidi is really nice.

191
00:09:47,184 --> 00:09:49,184
To be continued

192
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:57,650
Clara is missing. When all three of us are together, it's more and more fun.

193
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:00,650
I think she's nice. She's not arrogant at all.

194
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:04,650
Well, you see, and you got so busy when I said she was coming to visit us.

195
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,650
Oh, yes.

196
00:10:12,138 --> 00:10:17,138
It doesn't smell at all. I didn't think it was right that she complained.

197
00:10:17,138 --> 00:10:20,138
I mean Mrs. Rottenmeier, she always complained.

198
00:10:20,138 --> 00:10:25,138
I can imagine. She must have always walked around with her cloth in front of her
nose.

199
00:10:30,282 --> 00:10:33,282
What do you think of Clara's grandmother?

200
00:10:33,282 --> 00:10:35,282
Very decent.

201
00:10:35,282 --> 00:10:39,282
I also imagined her to be worse.

202
00:10:41,282 --> 00:10:43,282
She's not bad at all.

203
00:10:43,282 --> 00:10:45,282
Because of me.

204
00:10:52,522 --> 00:10:57,522
Mrs. Rottenmeier said that I never had a nap, but that's not true.

205
00:10:57,522 --> 00:11:00,522
We always lay on the meadow and dreamed.

206
00:11:00,522 --> 00:11:04,522
We then looked at the clouds and everyone had to say what they were reminded of.

207
00:11:04,522 --> 00:11:06,522
Most of them look like sheep.

208
00:11:06,522 --> 00:11:07,522
And that was fun.

209
00:11:07,522 --> 00:11:08,522
Yes, and how.

210
00:11:08,522 --> 00:11:12,522
You know, sometimes I wish so much that I can walk.

211
00:11:12,522 --> 00:11:16,522
I know, but you have to be healthy and strong first.

212
00:11:16,522 --> 00:11:18,522
Maybe you can do it one day.

213
00:11:18,522 --> 00:11:21,522
Tell me, have you ever tried to stand up?

214
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,208
But no!

215
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,208
What do you mean, but no?

216
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:31,208
Me, at your place, I would try it every day, secretly, so long until I suddenly
can.

217
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:35,208
Well, I've tried it before, but it didn't work.

218
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:55,208
THE END

219
00:11:55,274 --> 00:12:01,274
The islands in the sea, surrounded by greedy waves, lonely exposed to the
primordial wilderness of creation.

220
00:12:01,274 --> 00:12:07,274
So in ancient, long-past times, the few human settlements were taken out.

221
00:12:07,274 --> 00:12:15,274
They were surrounded by unbuilt, partly unrealistic land, by swamps, primordial
forests, seas and mountains.

222
00:12:47,574 --> 00:12:57,574
In the middle of the forest, there is a small forest, surrounded by swamps, by
swamps, by swamps, by swamps, by swamps, by swamps, by swamps, by swamps.

223
00:13:17,574 --> 00:13:28,554
At that moment, a dry

224
00:13:31,226 --> 00:13:36,226
Dear Clara, you jumped up. You stood up. I saw it.

225
00:13:36,226 --> 00:13:40,226
It's true. You can go. He's right, Clara.

226
00:13:42,226 --> 00:13:44,226
Hopefully it wasn't just an imitation.

227
00:13:44,226 --> 00:13:46,226
Oh, Clara.

228
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:49,226
No, it wasn't.

229
00:13:53,296 --> 00:13:56,296
What is it, man, for heaven's sake? What happened?

230
00:13:56,296 --> 00:14:01,296
Clara can walk. She was afraid of the cow and suddenly jumped up.

231
00:14:01,296 --> 00:14:03,296
Clara, say something.

232
00:14:03,296 --> 00:14:07,296
What should I say? I don't even know what to think.

233
00:14:07,296 --> 00:14:11,296
I knew it. You see, I knew it all the time.

234
00:14:11,296 --> 00:14:15,296
I'm glad. Isn't that wonderful, Clara?

235
00:14:15,296 --> 00:14:18,296
Do you think I can get up?

236
00:14:18,296 --> 00:14:19,792
Yes.

237
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:24,792
I still can't get it. Only yesterday did we both talk about it.

238
00:14:27,792 --> 00:14:31,792
Show it to us again. Try to get up, my child, please.

239
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:38,792
Something so stupid. How are you supposed to get up, poor thing, if I'm holding
you down all the time?

240
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:41,792
I can't get up at all.

241
00:14:42,792 --> 00:14:45,792
Oh yes, you can. You just have to try.

242
00:14:45,792 --> 00:14:46,792
Sure.

243
00:14:46,792 --> 00:14:47,792
Aha.

244
00:14:48,048 --> 00:14:51,048
Well, I could spend hours looking over there. 当然的,我可以找到几个人。

245
00:14:52,048 --> 00:14:53,048
Please, have courage. 请,有勇气。

246
00:14:53,048 --> 00:14:56,048
Just try one more time, okay? 尝试一次,好吗?

247
00:14:56,048 --> 00:14:58,048
You'll see, it'll work. 你会看到,会成功的。

248
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:07,210
Try! Try really hard! You have to want it!

249
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:10,210
I want to, but I can't!

250
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,210
Now, Clara!

251
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:15,210
Please believe me, it's not possible! Leave me alone!

252
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:18,210
Clara, one more time! You could have stood up!

253
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:22,210
No, it's not possible! No, no, no, I can't! I'm scared!

254
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:25,856
It's not possible, she has to want it alone! Come on, Clara!

255
00:15:25,856 --> 00:15:28,976
I'm sorry, Clara. I thought it would be easy now.

256
00:15:28,976 --> 00:15:31,576
Calm down, that was very exhausting for you.

257
00:15:31,576 --> 00:15:33,576
We'll try it again later.

258
00:15:36,456 --> 00:15:38,776
Grandmother, I brought you something!

259
00:15:39,434 --> 00:15:41,434
Grandmother!

260
00:15:41,434 --> 00:15:43,434
Clara! Grandfather!

261
00:15:49,434 --> 00:15:51,434
Who are you?

262
00:15:51,434 --> 00:15:52,202
Heidi!

263
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:54,202
I brought you something. There!

264
00:15:54,202 --> 00:15:57,202
Yes, what? What do you have?

265
00:15:59,702 --> 00:16:02,702
Something's not right. Is Clara sick?

266
00:16:03,202 --> 00:16:05,202
No, she got up.

267
00:16:06,202 --> 00:16:09,202
On her feet? They're lying to me.

268
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:14,202
No, they're not lying. It used to be like that, but now it's not.

269
00:16:14,202 --> 00:16:17,202
Yes, it would be like that now, too. She just doesn't dare.

270
00:16:17,202 --> 00:16:19,202
What?

271
00:16:19,202 --> 00:16:21,202
Well...

272
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,760
Why is she still being carried?

273
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,760
Lord, Clara will run at some point!

274
00:16:37,866 --> 00:16:39,866
Don't you want to show it to me?

275
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:41,866
I want to see it so much, Clara.

276
00:16:41,866 --> 00:16:42,866
I don't know, Heidi.

277
00:16:42,866 --> 00:16:43,866
Don't force her.

278
00:16:43,866 --> 00:16:45,866
She'll try it on her own some day.

279
00:16:45,866 --> 00:16:47,866
We saw that you can do it.

280
00:16:47,866 --> 00:16:49,866
Have self-confidence, my child.

281
00:16:49,866 --> 00:16:50,866
It works.

282
00:16:51,866 --> 00:16:53,866
Aren't you happy, Clara?

283
00:17:02,866 --> 00:17:04,866
She can run!

284
00:17:07,018 --> 00:17:10,018
One day she will walk with us.

285
00:17:14,018 --> 00:17:16,018
One day she will walk.

286
00:17:16,018 --> 00:17:19,018
So beautiful to be true.

287
00:17:24,714 --> 00:17:28,714
Don't you want to stop working for a moment?

288
00:17:29,714 --> 00:17:31,714
You also have a few days of rest.

289
00:17:31,714 --> 00:17:33,714
You work from morning to evening.

290
00:17:33,714 --> 00:17:34,714
Oh, what am I talking about?

291
00:17:34,714 --> 00:17:36,714
You will know what you are doing.

292
00:17:36,714 --> 00:17:39,714
Excuse me, but I'm so confused.

293
00:17:39,714 --> 00:17:42,714
It's exactly what you said.

294
00:17:42,714 --> 00:17:45,714
And I didn't believe you.

295
00:17:45,714 --> 00:17:48,714
I don't know what to think anymore.

296
00:17:48,714 --> 00:17:51,714
What if I just imagined it all?

297
00:17:51,714 --> 00:17:53,712
But no!

298
00:17:53,712 --> 00:17:59,512
I saw it with my own eyes. I can't imagine it. Suddenly she stood up.

299
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:00,712
She will be healthy.

300
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:05,512
Excuse me for getting so upset, but I can't understand it. I'd rather scream.

301
00:18:05,512 --> 00:18:06,712
Do it.

302
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:10,212
If I only knew how I could give her self-confidence.

303
00:18:10,212 --> 00:18:16,212
If she would try it just once. Just once, then she would believe it too and
would be healed.

304
00:18:16,212 --> 00:18:20,712
Maybe I should go on a trip with the children. Maybe then an opportunity will
arise.

305
00:18:21,808 --> 00:18:25,008
Oh, if only my son would have been there too.

306
00:18:25,008 --> 00:18:28,508
Now I can only write it to him and he won't be able to believe it.

307
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:32,008
And we owe it all to you and a cow.

308
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:44,522
Don't tell fairy tales again!

309
00:18:44,522 --> 00:18:46,522
No, I don't tell fairy tales, it's true!

310
00:18:46,522 --> 00:18:47,522
Clara!

311
00:18:47,522 --> 00:18:49,522
Heidi says you can stand up.

312
00:18:49,522 --> 00:18:52,522
Yes, they all say that, but I don't know if it's true.

313
00:18:52,522 --> 00:18:56,522
Clara, now stop it, the grandmother saw it.

314
00:18:56,522 --> 00:18:58,522
I know, but I'm afraid that she only dreamed it.

315
00:18:58,522 --> 00:18:59,522
You just don't have to be afraid.

316
00:18:59,522 --> 00:19:02,522
No one dreamed, you were afraid of the cow.

317
00:19:02,522 --> 00:19:03,522
It would be nice, right?

318
00:19:03,522 --> 00:19:04,522
Yes.

319
00:19:04,784 --> 00:19:07,984
Then I could run around with you everywhere and no one would have to carry me.
Then I could run around with you everywhere and no one would have to carry me.

320
00:19:07,984 --> 00:19:12,284
Why do you always say could? It's true, you can do it, you just have to try.

321
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:13,484
Exactly.

322
00:19:13,484 --> 00:19:15,984
Why don't you just try it?

323
00:19:15,984 --> 00:19:17,584
You're back already?

324
00:19:17,584 --> 00:19:19,284
I didn't feel like it anymore.

325
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:23,284
Would you like to take the girls and me to the mountain lake you're talking
about?

326
00:19:23,284 --> 00:19:24,784
Yes!

327
00:19:24,784 --> 00:19:28,584
If you all feel like it, then we can go too. I'll take food with me.

328
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,984
Oh yes, but please take a lot with you.

329
00:19:30,984 --> 00:19:34,184
Clara is on the way for three.

330
00:19:34,192 --> 00:19:35,592
As much as we can carry.

331
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:36,092
Good.

332
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:38,792
Heidi has often written in her letters from the lake.

333
00:19:38,792 --> 00:19:40,392
I always wanted to see him.

334
00:19:41,192 --> 00:19:43,092
Do you think we can all do it together,

335
00:19:43,092 --> 00:19:44,492
to bring Clara up there?

336
00:19:44,492 --> 00:19:46,592
It should be pretty unobtrusive up there.

337
00:19:47,192 --> 00:19:48,492
We'll do that.

338
00:19:49,492 --> 00:19:51,792
Let's promise not to turn around.

339
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:57,892
Promised is promised and will not be broken.

340
00:19:57,892 --> 00:19:59,092
And again.

341
00:19:59,312 --> 00:20:02,812
Promised is promised and will not be broken.

342
00:20:02,812 --> 00:20:06,312
No one should know until Clara has seen the lake, no matter how hard.

343
00:20:06,312 --> 00:20:07,812
Yes, no one.

344
00:20:07,812 --> 00:20:10,812
Promised is promised and will not be broken.

345
00:20:45,782 --> 00:20:52,782
A lullaby, a lullaby, a lullaby, a lullaby

346
00:21:15,782 --> 00:21:21,782
lullaby, lullaby, lullaby, a lullaby

347
00:21:45,782 --> 00:21:54,782
lullaby, a lullaby, a lullaby, a lullaby, a lullaby

348
00:22:15,782 --> 00:22:20,782
lullaby, a lullaby, a lullaby, a lullaby

349
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:48,782
lullaby, a lullaby, a lullaby

350
00:22:49,386 --> 00:22:53,966
When they came home in the evening, they all told their grandfather about this

351
00:22:53,966 --> 00:22:57,866
magical beautiful day up at the lake. Although Peter was tired of the

352
00:22:57,866 --> 00:23:01,666
exhausting hiking, Heidi persuaded him to take part in a

353
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:07,826
mysterious plan, which she didn't want to explain to him yet.
