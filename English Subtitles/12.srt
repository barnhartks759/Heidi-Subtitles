Your world are the mountains

Heidi

00:00:33,678 --> 00:00:37,678
Because up here you are at home

7
00:00:37,678 --> 00:00:41,678
Dark pines

8
00:00:41,678 --> 00:00:45,678
Green meadows in the sunshine

Heidi, Heidi

10
00:00:49,678 --> 00:00:53,678
You need to be happy

Find your happiness

25
00:02:00,786 --> 00:02:02,786
Hello, Joseph.

26
00:02:02,786 --> 00:02:06,786
Now you've already thrown everything down for the second time!

27
00:02:06,786 --> 00:02:08,786
Wait!

29
00:02:10,786 --> 00:02:12,786

I'll catch you! Now stay here!

33
00:02:19,846 --> 00:02:21,846
Now I'll catch you!

34
00:02:31,846 --> 00:02:33,846
That's what happens when you don't bark!

35
00:02:35,846 --> 00:02:37,846
No! You can't catch me!

36
00:02:37,846 --> 00:02:39,846
I won't give you any trouble!

37
00:02:39,846 --> 00:02:41,846
Stop! Help!

38
00:02:41,846 --> 00:02:43,846
This child!

39
00:02:43,846 --> 00:02:45,846
I'll catch you!

40
00:02:45,846 --> 00:02:47,846
This child!

41
00:02:47,846 --> 00:02:49,846
No, Joseph! Stop!

42
00:02:51,846 --> 00:02:53,846
Slowly!

43
00:02:53,846 --> 00:02:55,846
Wait!

44
00:02:57,846 --> 00:02:59,386
Hello, Joseph!

45
00:02:59,386 --> 00:03:03,386
Stop licking my hand! You know it tickles!

46
00:03:03,386 --> 00:03:05,386
Grandfather, come here!

47
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:07,386
Look at our tree!

48
00:03:07,386 --> 00:03:08,730
That's...

49
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,430
Nice. It glitters everywhere and sparkles like a thousand stars.

50
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,730
And listen to how it roars.

51
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,730
He'll talk to me at some point.

52
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,730
Nice, Joseph.

53
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,730
So, what did I tell you?

54
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,730
He'll talk to us.

55
00:03:34,522 --> 00:03:38,522
If you want to catch me, you have to come up with something, Joseph.

56
00:03:39,522 --> 00:03:41,522
Come on, what are you waiting for?

57
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,130
Stop it, you two!

58
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:48,130
Come in! You haven't even had breakfast!

59
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,130
We have to go!

60
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:55,130
I'm coming! I have to wash my hands first!

61
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,130
Come on, Joseph!

62
00:03:59,394 --> 00:04:02,394
Sven, don't be so shy about the water. You could take a swim.

63
00:04:02,394 --> 00:04:04,394
It's not a big deal.

64
00:04:04,394 --> 00:04:06,394
It's so cold.

65
00:04:06,394 --> 00:04:08,394
Where are you going? Come here!

66
00:04:08,394 --> 00:04:10,394
Oh, the snow.

67
00:04:15,194 --> 00:04:17,194
The snow is melting.

68
00:04:25,194 --> 00:04:28,194
Come here quickly! There's a flower here!

69
00:04:30,194 --> 00:04:32,194
A flower.

70
00:04:32,826 --> 00:04:36,826
Joseph, smell it. It smells like spring.

71
00:04:37,826 --> 00:04:40,826
Now it's going to get warmer every day.

72
00:04:42,826 --> 00:04:45,826
Have you ever seen such a beautiful flower?

73
00:04:45,826 --> 00:04:48,826
Let's go and get Grandfather.

74
00:04:48,826 --> 00:04:50,826
The first flower, the first flower!

75
00:04:50,826 --> 00:04:52,826
Come with me, I have to show you something.

76
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:53,826
Come on!

77
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:56,826
Why are you so excited again now?

78
00:04:56,826 --> 00:04:57,826
Look!

79
00:04:57,826 --> 00:04:59,826
I think spring is coming.

80
00:05:02,826 --> 00:05:03,802
That's it!

81
00:05:03,802 --> 00:05:07,802
Tell me, have you ever seen such a beautiful flower?

82
00:05:07,802 --> 00:05:10,802
That's what happens to us every time in spring.

83
00:05:10,802 --> 00:05:14,802
Don't you like the flower? I think it's very beautiful.

84
00:05:14,802 --> 00:05:16,802
Of course I like it.

85
00:05:18,802 --> 00:05:21,802
With the first flower you always think it's the most beautiful.

86
00:05:21,802 --> 00:05:25,802
I'm glad that the winter is over and spring is coming.

87
00:05:25,802 --> 00:05:31,802
I will come here every day and see if she is doing well and if she has grown a
bit.

88
00:05:33,114 --> 00:05:35,114
Hm? What is that?

89
00:05:38,114 --> 00:05:40,114
It's thundering like in summer.

90
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:46,378
What's that?

91
00:05:46,378 --> 00:05:48,378
There's an avalanche going down.

92
00:05:48,378 --> 00:05:50,378
That's also a sign that it's going to be spring.

93
00:05:50,378 --> 00:05:52,378
It was warm a few days ago.

94
00:05:52,378 --> 00:05:54,378
First the snow starts melting

95
00:05:54,378 --> 00:05:56,378
and then it slips off.

96
00:05:56,378 --> 00:05:58,378
And what then?

97
00:05:58,378 --> 00:06:00,378
First it's just a little snow.

98
00:06:00,378 --> 00:06:02,378
Then it gets more and more snow

99
00:06:02,378 --> 00:06:04,378
and finally an avalanche.

100
00:06:04,378 --> 00:06:06,378
Avalanches are very dangerous.

101
00:06:06,378 --> 00:06:08,378
So be careful whenever you hear this noise.

102
00:06:08,378 --> 00:06:10,378
And now come.

103
00:06:10,378 --> 00:06:11,904
Dangerous?

104
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:15,904
You know what, Joseph? We're just going to clear the avalanches.

105
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,190
We're going to clear the avalanches.

106
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,190
We're going to clear the avalanches.

107
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,190
Heidi!

108
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,234
Peter is there! I have to...

109
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:16,234
I'll show him my flower right away.

110
00:07:16,234 --> 00:07:17,234
First breakfast.

111
00:07:17,234 --> 00:07:19,234
Sit back down on the table.

112
00:07:19,234 --> 00:07:21,234
Your flower won't run away from you.

113
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,234
Very well.

114
00:07:31,098 --> 00:07:34,098
Do you always sleep, Joseph?

115
00:07:40,154 --> 00:07:42,154
Where did you get the flower?

116
00:07:44,154 --> 00:07:46,154
You found a spring flower, Joseph.

117
00:07:46,154 --> 00:07:48,154
That's the first one I get to see this year.

118
00:07:48,154 --> 00:07:50,154
Good morning, Peter.

119
00:07:50,154 --> 00:07:52,154
Good morning, Heidi. Look what I found.

120
00:07:52,154 --> 00:07:54,154
Thank you, but that's...

121
00:07:54,154 --> 00:07:56,154
Why did you tear the flower out?

122
00:07:56,154 --> 00:07:58,154
I didn't do that.

123
00:07:58,154 --> 00:08:00,154
What did I do wrong again?

124
00:08:00,154 --> 00:08:02,154
I found it.

125
00:08:02,154 --> 00:08:04,154
It's not my fault!

126
00:08:04,154 --> 00:08:06,154
You tore it out! Say something!

127
00:08:06,154 --> 00:08:08,154
Joseph?

128
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,154
I didn't fall in!

129
00:08:22,154 --> 00:08:23,354
Is that all?

130
00:08:23,354 --> 00:08:25,354
- What is it? - This dog.

131
00:08:25,354 --> 00:08:27,354
Please, Peter, give me the flower.

132
00:08:27,354 --> 00:08:30,354
- It needs water. - Oh, it's already completely wilted.

133
00:08:31,354 --> 00:08:34,354
General Siegen, have you had enough breakfast this morning?

134
00:08:34,354 --> 00:08:36,354
I have had breakfast.

135
00:08:36,354 --> 00:08:38,354
But my stomach could bear something.

136
00:08:38,354 --> 00:08:41,354
That would have surprised me if it were different.

137
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,354
I'm just always hungry.

138
00:08:43,354 --> 00:08:44,354
No, come on.

139
00:08:44,354 --> 00:08:47,354
When I was as old as you, I was always hungry too.

140
00:08:47,354 --> 00:08:49,354
Thank you very much, Mr. Peter.

141
00:08:52,954 --> 00:08:56,954
How can you get such pieces in your mouth at once?

142
00:08:56,954 --> 00:09:00,954
So your mouth must be the biggest mouth in the world.

143
00:09:00,954 --> 00:09:02,954
It's not that big.

144
00:09:05,954 --> 00:09:07,954
Oh, there it is again.

145
00:09:07,954 --> 00:09:11,954
It's thundering. There must be another avalanche going down the mountain.

146
00:09:11,954 --> 00:09:13,954
Have you ever seen one?

147
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:15,954
Peter!

148
00:09:16,954 --> 00:09:18,954
Stop it now!

149
00:09:19,954 --> 00:09:21,648
But I'm not even full yet.

150
00:09:21,648 --> 00:09:24,408
You'll never be full!

151
00:09:24,408 --> 00:09:27,408
You can eat from morning till evening!

152
00:09:33,094 --> 00:09:35,094
We're at least as fast as birds. We're flying!

153
00:10:03,094 --> 00:10:05,094
We're flying!

154
00:10:08,094 --> 00:10:11,094
Stop the cut, Peter! I saw something over there!

155
00:10:11,094 --> 00:10:12,094
What did you say?

156
00:10:12,094 --> 00:10:14,094
You should be on fire!

157
00:10:15,094 --> 00:10:18,094
Wait a second, I'll be right back!

158
00:10:29,094 --> 00:10:30,810
I've got something!

159
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:34,810
Oh, now you've plucked it. But that's why you yelled at me earlier.

160
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:37,810
That's only the second flower of spring.

161
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:41,810
You always come up with an answer.

162
00:10:45,146 --> 00:10:47,146
I'm curious what Grandmother says.

163
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,146
We've arrived!

164
00:10:49,146 --> 00:10:51,146
Is Heidi with us?

165
00:10:51,146 --> 00:10:52,146
Of course I'm here.

166
00:10:52,146 --> 00:10:54,146
Good day, Brigitte. How are you today?

167
00:10:54,146 --> 00:10:56,146
I brought you something.

168
00:10:56,146 --> 00:10:58,146
What did you bring me?

169
00:10:58,146 --> 00:11:00,146
A flower. We found it in the snow.

170
00:11:00,146 --> 00:11:04,146
That's right. It's finally spring.

171
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,770
How well it smells.

172
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,770
You made me very happy with that.

173
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,770
That's what I thought.

174
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,770
I knew you liked the flower.

175
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,770
Now it's going up again.

176
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:23,770
Heidi brought a snowflake.

177
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,770
The spring is coming.

178
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,770
Did you notice, Brigitte?

179
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,770
I don't have time to think about something like that anymore.

180
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:33,770
I know you always have a lot to do, Brigitte.

181
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:37,770
But for the first snowflake, you should be able to take some time.

182
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,770
You're right, Grandmother.

183
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:41,696
Thank you for that. You're pretty stupid.

184
00:11:41,696 --> 00:11:45,896
I didn't want to hurt you, Heidi. It's very, very beautiful.

185
00:11:49,296 --> 00:11:51,696
I don't think anyone else cares about me here.

186
00:11:51,696 --> 00:11:52,696
Let's get out of here.

187
00:11:52,696 --> 00:11:53,696
From me.

188
00:11:53,696 --> 00:11:55,096
We have to go.

189
00:11:55,096 --> 00:11:58,296
Goodbye, Grandmother. I'll be back very soon.

190
00:11:59,296 --> 00:12:01,896
Don't come back as late as yesterday, Peter.

191
00:12:02,896 --> 00:12:06,096
What kind of a lovely girl is this Heidi?

192
00:12:11,696 --> 00:12:15,696
Stop! No, Heidi! You can't do that normally!

193
00:12:22,554 --> 00:12:25,054
Why shouldn't I be able to do that? It's so easy.

194
00:12:25,054 --> 00:12:27,554
You sit on it and control it with your feet.

195
00:12:27,554 --> 00:12:29,054
Please, if it's that easy...

196
00:12:29,054 --> 00:12:32,054
I'll show you. You'll be surprised how good I can do it.

197
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,054
And off we go!

198
00:12:41,054 --> 00:12:43,854
Now we're getting faster! And now to the curve!

199
00:12:43,854 --> 00:12:45,054
Watch out!

200
00:12:45,554 --> 00:12:47,054
Peter, we're getting too fast!

201
00:12:47,054 --> 00:12:48,554
Peter!

202
00:12:52,554 --> 00:12:53,554
Ouch!

203
00:12:59,054 --> 00:13:00,054
What do you say?

204
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,954
How did you drive?

205
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:05,442
Ohhhhhhh...

206
00:13:05,442 --> 00:13:06,982
Ahhhh!

207
00:13:06,982 --> 00:13:07,982
Ahahaha!

208
00:13:07,982 --> 00:13:08,982
Ahahaha!

209
00:13:08,982 --> 00:13:09,982
Ahahaha!

210
00:13:09,982 --> 00:13:10,982
Ahahaha!

211
00:13:10,982 --> 00:13:11,982
Ahahaha!

212
00:13:11,982 --> 00:13:12,982
Watch out, without the tail!

213
00:13:12,982 --> 00:13:13,982
Stop it!

214
00:13:13,982 --> 00:13:14,982
Ouch!

215
00:13:14,982 --> 00:13:15,982
Ouch!

216
00:13:22,982 --> 00:13:23,982
No!

217
00:13:25,982 --> 00:13:26,982
Hurray!

218
00:13:27,982 --> 00:13:28,982
Hooray!

219
00:13:28,982 --> 00:13:29,982
Hooray!

220
00:13:29,982 --> 00:13:30,982
Watch out!

221
00:13:32,982 --> 00:13:33,982
Ouch!

222
00:13:33,982 --> 00:13:34,982
Ouch!

223
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:36,982
Ahhhh!

224
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:46,770
If you ask me again how you were driving, I'll scream!

225
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:48,770
How was I driving?

226
00:13:49,478 --> 00:14:08,478
Well, you snails, where do you want to go so slowly?

227
00:14:08,478 --> 00:14:12,478
You have to prove that you are faster!

228
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:14,478
Watch out!

229
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:17,478
Watch out!

230
00:14:19,478 --> 00:14:24,478
If I catch you!

231
00:14:24,478 --> 00:14:26,478
And if you catch us!

232
00:14:26,478 --> 00:14:28,478
I'm curious about that!

233
00:14:39,258 --> 00:14:42,058
That's it. The strange thing from the Alp.

234
00:14:42,058 --> 00:14:44,258
What do you mean, the strange thing?

235
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:47,258
If you live with the old man, you have to be strange.

236
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,690
- You're stupid. - She's cheeky.

237
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,690
Even pretty cheeky.

238
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:58,690
- Tell me, is that right with you? - Leave her alone, I warn you!

239
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,690
You slug, what do you want?

240
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,690
Is it fun to play with girls?

241
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,690
Do you already wear a skirt and a nice hat?

242
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,690
And pretty white socks?

243
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,690
Girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend!

244
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,690
What does "girlfriend" mean?

245
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,690
Shut your mouth, you scoundrel!

246
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,690
Do you want me to beat you up?

247
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:15,690
Shut up!

248
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,488
Why are you so angry?

249
00:15:17,488 --> 00:15:19,888
Is it Heidi or is it not her?

250
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,288
It's none of your business.

251
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:25,288
He only feels so strong because the girl is with him.

252
00:15:27,488 --> 00:15:31,688
Usually he runs faster than his goats when it gets dangerous somewhere.

253
00:15:31,888 --> 00:15:33,488
And you're overtaking me.

254
00:15:33,688 --> 00:15:34,888
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

255
00:15:35,088 --> 00:15:38,088
Now he's about to start crying too, the poor little one.

256
00:15:38,288 --> 00:15:39,688
Oh nonsense.

257
00:15:42,488 --> 00:15:44,488
I would apologize at your place.

258
00:15:44,688 --> 00:15:46,488
Only if we go around the bet.

259
00:15:46,928 --> 00:15:48,928
Fine, we can do that.

260
00:15:48,928 --> 00:15:51,928
If we win, then you apologize at our place.

261
00:15:51,928 --> 00:15:52,928
Dismissed.

262
00:15:52,928 --> 00:15:54,928
But don't make any hope yet. You'll never win.

263
00:15:54,928 --> 00:15:56,928
We're the fastest anyway.

264
00:15:56,928 --> 00:15:58,928
Don't drive on the tree.

265
00:15:58,928 --> 00:16:02,928
Let me steer. If I sit in the front, then we'll make it.

266
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:04,928
Never!

267
00:16:08,922 --> 00:16:13,922
- Don't you want to fight? - It's our business how we drive!

268
00:16:13,922 --> 00:16:16,922
Then you don't want to win today at all!

269
00:16:17,922 --> 00:16:19,922
Only beginners push!

270
00:16:19,922 --> 00:16:21,922
Only beginners push!

271
00:16:27,354 --> 00:16:31,354
The first one to reach the market place first wins.

272
00:16:31,354 --> 00:16:33,354
The ride is going to be wild. Hold on tight, okay?

273
00:16:33,354 --> 00:16:34,354
Yes.

274
00:16:34,354 --> 00:16:35,354
Let's go!

275
00:16:35,354 --> 00:16:39,354
One, two, three!

276
00:16:44,026 --> 00:16:46,026
Oh, they're so slow!

277
00:16:51,462 --> 00:16:52,462
Goodbye!

278
00:16:52,462 --> 00:16:54,462
We haven't shown you what we're capable of!

279
00:16:54,462 --> 00:16:56,462
Then don't think about it for too long!

280
00:17:07,462 --> 00:17:10,462
Are you having a breakfast break or where are you staying for so long?

281
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:13,462
Are you having a breakfast break or where are you staying for so long?

282
00:17:21,462 --> 00:17:24,462
Now you have to come up with something and you're stuck!

283
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,462
We have to win!

284
00:17:32,462 --> 00:17:33,462
Stop!

285
00:17:34,462 --> 00:17:36,462
Goodbye!

286
00:17:38,462 --> 00:17:39,462
That's how it's supposed to be!

287
00:17:39,462 --> 00:17:40,462
That's how it's supposed to be!

288
00:17:40,462 --> 00:17:41,462
That's how it's supposed to be!

289
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:43,462
We won!

290
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:44,462
Hurray!

291
00:17:44,462 --> 00:17:45,462
Hurray!

292
00:17:45,462 --> 00:17:46,462
Hurray!

293
00:17:46,462 --> 00:17:47,462
Hurray!

294
00:17:47,462 --> 00:17:48,462
Hurray!

295
00:17:49,462 --> 00:17:50,462
Hurray!

296
00:17:50,462 --> 00:17:51,462
Hurray!

297
00:17:55,802 --> 00:17:57,602
Well, that's it then.

298
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,202
Heidi!

299
00:18:00,102 --> 00:18:01,502
Up here!

300
00:18:01,594 --> 00:18:03,594
You're right.

301
00:18:03,594 --> 00:18:05,594
Hurry up!

302
00:18:05,594 --> 00:18:07,594
I should have let you lie down.

303
00:18:07,594 --> 00:18:09,594
You're alive, Peter.

304
00:18:09,594 --> 00:18:11,594
I hope it didn't hurt.

305
00:18:11,594 --> 00:18:13,594
Peter!

306
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:15,594
We won!

307
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,890
That doesn't matter.

308
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,890
A little bit, yes.

309
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,890
Where are you staying?

310
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,890
You wanted to win, didn't you?

311
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:31,890
If only they would fall into an ice-cold stream.

312
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:36,890
I want to know how Schnucke and the goats are doing.

313
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:38,890
Huh?

314
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,890
How did you come up with that?

315
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:44,890
I don't know either. I just came up with it.

316
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,890
Come on, let's go visit them, okay?

317
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:49,890
Today, where we've lost them, you're going to visit the goats?

318
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,890
You might have some ideas.

319
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,890
We'll visit the goats next time. We have to go back now.

320
00:18:58,890 --> 00:18:58,992
We'll visit the goats next time.

321
00:18:58,992 --> 00:19:00,992
It's starting to rain.

322
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:19,930
The bots are pitch black. We have to see that we can get into the forest as
quickly as possible.

323
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,930
Where are the two of them?

324
00:19:32,474 --> 00:19:36,474
It's pouring out of the buckets! We have to hurry! Come on!

325
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:39,094
Heidi! Peter!

326
00:20:07,094 --> 00:20:09,094
Peter! Heidi!

327
00:20:23,418 --> 00:20:25,418
Head up, you're holding on.

328
00:20:25,418 --> 00:20:27,418
My legs are made of lead.

329
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,906
Thanks for watching!

330
00:20:54,906 --> 00:20:56,906
Thank you for your time.

331
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,730
Come on, Peter, over here!

332
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,730
There comes the old man!

333
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,730
Peter, quick!

334
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:38,394
Now we can't drive anymore. Our beautiful snow is gone.

335
00:21:38,394 --> 00:21:41,394
Where does so much water come from all of a sudden?

336
00:21:41,394 --> 00:21:43,394
So you're asking questions.

337
00:21:43,394 --> 00:21:46,394
But where does the water come from when the snow melts?

338
00:21:47,394 --> 00:21:51,394
The winter couldn't resist the spring anymore.

339
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:56,394
From day to day it got warmer and the air was full of the bird's chirping.

340
00:21:57,394 --> 00:22:02,394
Where the snow had already melted, the first grass tips appeared.

341
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,780
And spring flowers started to bloom everywhere.

342
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,880
Soon the last drop of snow would have disappeared too.

343
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,180
Heidi continued to feed her deer, even though they had been able to find their
own food for a long time.

344
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,330
The next day

345
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:37,330
The two are as happy as we are about the spring.

346
00:22:52,378 --> 00:22:56,378
Heidi experienced her first spring up here in the mountains.

347
00:22:56,378 --> 00:23:01,378
She stood up every morning with the sun to not lose a second of the day.

348
00:23:01,378 --> 00:23:05,378
For her, one experience was more exciting than the other.

349
00:23:05,378 --> 00:23:08,378
She was overworked and overjoyed.

350
00:23:08,378 --> 00:23:12,378
Like in summer, Peter came up to the meadows again with the goat herd.

351
00:23:12,378 --> 00:23:16,378
And together they spent unwavering days in the meadow.

352
00:23:16,378 --> 00:23:20,378
Heidi met her favorite goat Schnucki again.

353
00:23:20,512 --> 00:23:23,512
And calculated whether none of her friends were missing.

354
00:23:23,512 --> 00:23:27,512
But we want to tell you about that in our next story.

355
00:23:28,518 --> 00:23:39,038
Heidi, Heidi, your world is the mountains.

356
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:47,238
Heidi, Heidi, because up here you are at home.

357
00:23:47,238 --> 00:24:00,238
Heidi, Heidi, come home, find your happiness, come back home.
