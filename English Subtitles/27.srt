00:00:24,398 --> 00:00:28,398
Your world are the mountains

00:00:28,398 --> 00:00:32,398
Heidi

6
00:00:32,398 --> 00:00:36,398
Because up here you are at home

7
00:00:36,398 --> 00:00:40,398
Dark berries

8
00:00:40,398 --> 00:00:44,398
Green meadows in the sunshine

9
00:00:44,398 --> 00:00:48,398
Heidi, Heidi

10
00:00:48,398 --> 00:00:52,398
You need to be happy

00:01:09,398 --> 00:01:12,398
Come home

16
00:01:12,398 --> 00:01:14,398
Find your happiness

17
00:01:14,398 --> 00:01:18,398
Come back

18
00:01:23,674 --> 00:01:25,674
Martinet, where are you going?

19
00:01:29,274 --> 00:01:31,674
I don't think I can get anything out of the way.

20
00:01:32,174 --> 00:01:34,174
The old lady is no longer the youngest.

21
00:01:34,174 --> 00:01:35,674
Yes, yes, I'm driving slowly.

22
00:01:35,674 --> 00:01:36,674
It's done.

23
00:01:36,674 --> 00:01:37,674
Good, good.

24
00:01:38,174 --> 00:01:39,174
Then I'll drive.

25
00:01:39,174 --> 00:01:40,174
Good.

26
00:01:49,114 --> 00:01:52,114
When you're done with my hair, I'll comb you.

27
00:01:52,114 --> 00:01:54,114
I like my hair the way it is.

28
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,114
Nevertheless, you have to be combed.

29
00:01:56,114 --> 00:01:58,114
You know, today the grandmother is coming.

30
00:01:58,114 --> 00:02:00,114
Do you mean she's cursing?

31
00:02:00,114 --> 00:02:03,114
Grandmother never cusses, but you want to look pretty.

32
00:02:03,114 --> 00:02:06,114
Is your grandmother very strict with children?

33
00:02:06,114 --> 00:02:09,114
But no, she is kind and friendly and always nice.

34
00:02:09,114 --> 00:02:12,114
And why doesn't your grandmother live with you here in the house?

35
00:02:12,114 --> 00:02:14,112
It's big enough.

36
00:02:14,112 --> 00:02:19,212
Frankfurt is too big and too loud for you. She says she's old and wants to live
in a quieter, smaller town.

37
00:02:19,212 --> 00:02:23,112
And why do you live here and don't live with her in the smaller town?

38
00:02:23,112 --> 00:02:28,212
Because there are no private teachers there. They only exist in the city. And I
still have to learn a lot, as you know.

39
00:02:28,212 --> 00:02:30,512
And not just me. You too.

40
00:02:30,512 --> 00:02:31,512
Unfortunately.

41
00:02:33,012 --> 00:02:37,012
Give me the comb. You must also want to be pretty and like my grandmother.

42
00:02:37,012 --> 00:02:38,012
Mhm.

44
00:02:45,786 --> 00:02:48,786
Is your grandmother like Mrs. Rottenmeier?

45
00:02:48,786 --> 00:02:51,786
Oh, don't be afraid. She's really different.

46
00:02:51,786 --> 00:02:54,786
You like her for sure. All children like her.

47
00:02:54,786 --> 00:02:57,786
I think she's nice when I say grandmother.

48
00:02:57,786 --> 00:03:00,786
I think you should, but you have to ask her first.

49
00:03:00,786 --> 00:03:03,786
If we want to, she'll tell us fairy tales all day.

50
00:03:03,786 --> 00:03:05,786
She knows all there is to know.

51
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:08,786
You know what, Clara? I already like your grandmother.

52
00:03:08,786 --> 00:03:11,786
Abelheim, please come to me, my child.

53
00:03:14,033 --> 00:03:18,033
Is the grandmother already here, Mrs. Rottenmeier?

54
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:22,033
Adelheid, how many times do I have to tell you to knock?

55
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:23,033
That was on purpose.

56
00:03:23,033 --> 00:03:26,033
I don't want to be on purpose. Go out right now!

57
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:27,033
Yes.

58
00:03:27,033 --> 00:03:28,033
We'll practice until you can do it.

59
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:32,033
Imagine I'm Mrs. Sesemann and you come in to greet me.

60
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:39,033
Hi!

61
00:03:39,473 --> 00:03:40,973
Hello, Mrs. Rottenmeier.

62
00:03:40,973 --> 00:03:42,973
Of course.

63
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:45,973
It's not called Mrs. Rottenmeier and not at all hello!

64
00:03:45,973 --> 00:03:47,973
I am Mrs. Sesemann, understood?

65
00:03:47,973 --> 00:03:49,973
I see.

66
00:03:49,973 --> 00:03:52,973
You come in and ask, how are you, Mrs. Sesemann?

67
00:03:52,973 --> 00:03:53,973
Where is Mrs. Sesemann?

68
00:03:53,973 --> 00:03:56,473
It has no purpose, it has no purpose.

69
00:03:56,473 --> 00:03:57,973
You should speak loudly.

70
00:03:57,973 --> 00:03:58,973
Where is she?

71
00:03:58,973 --> 00:03:59,973
Calm down!

72
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,473
No one can be so stupid.

73
00:04:01,473 --> 00:04:02,973
We start from the beginning.

74
00:04:04,473 --> 00:04:06,973
Good day, grandmother, how are you?

75
00:04:07,143 --> 00:04:10,143
Who gave you permission to call her grandmother?

76
00:04:10,143 --> 00:04:12,643
No one, but I'm sure she will.

77
00:04:12,643 --> 00:04:16,643
She is the grandmother of Mrs. Clara and only she has the permission to call her
that.

78
00:04:16,643 --> 00:04:18,643
All the others call her kind lady.

79
00:04:18,643 --> 00:04:19,643
Why?

80
00:04:19,643 --> 00:04:23,143
Remember well, Mrs. Sesemann is the lady of this house.

81
00:04:23,143 --> 00:04:25,643
We have to meet her with great pride.

82
00:04:25,643 --> 00:04:30,643
She is a fine old lady and she knows exactly how to appreciate good behavior, my
child.

83
00:04:30,643 --> 00:04:34,143
She does not deserve any noise and no impudence near her.

84
00:04:34,263 --> 00:04:37,663
And if you move aside, it will fall back on me.

85
00:04:37,663 --> 00:04:40,263
But Clara said she is very nice.

86
00:04:40,263 --> 00:04:41,663
Of course she is.

87
00:04:41,663 --> 00:04:44,263
Besides, she demands absolute obedience.

88
00:04:44,263 --> 00:04:47,263
Then she's not a grandmother, then she's like you.

89
00:04:47,263 --> 00:04:49,263
Nobility, you're talking nonsense.

90
00:04:49,263 --> 00:04:51,263
I'm not talking nonsense.

91
00:04:51,263 --> 00:04:54,663
That's part of it, too. The kind lady doesn't want any objection.

92
00:04:54,663 --> 00:04:55,663
Good.

93
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,463
What's going on again?

94
00:04:59,463 --> 00:05:01,463
What's wrong with the picture, Sebastian?

95
00:05:01,655 --> 00:05:03,855
I wanted to hang it on the wall. That's all.

96
00:05:03,855 --> 00:05:05,855
Why? There's already a picture hanging on the wall.

97
00:05:05,855 --> 00:05:09,155
I wanted to exchange it. This is the favorite picture of the Blessed Virgin.

98
00:05:09,155 --> 00:05:10,955
That's pure waste of time.

99
00:05:10,955 --> 00:05:12,555
But I thought...

100
00:05:12,555 --> 00:05:14,855
They shouldn't think, they should do their job.

101
00:05:14,855 --> 00:05:16,755
And what they do, that's what I decide.

102
00:05:16,755 --> 00:05:17,855
Yes, ma'am.

103
00:05:19,755 --> 00:05:21,355
Wait a moment!

104
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:23,755
What are you wearing over your arm, Tinette?

105
00:05:23,755 --> 00:05:24,755
Fork angel.

106
00:05:24,755 --> 00:05:27,655
Are you both making fun of me or what's going on here?

107
00:05:27,655 --> 00:05:30,055
What do you want to start with these curtains?

108
00:05:30,055 --> 00:05:30,955
Hang them up.

109
00:05:30,983 --> 00:05:33,683
The noble lady prefers bright colors in the house.

110
00:05:33,683 --> 00:05:37,183
Mr. Sesemann has transferred me the management of his household.

111
00:05:37,183 --> 00:05:41,183
And I can't remember that I gave the order to exchange the curtains.

112
00:05:43,283 --> 00:05:46,983
Oh, there she is! What are you standing around for? Hurry up!

113
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:52,383
And you, Adelheid, please don't forget what we practiced together earlier.

114
00:05:52,383 --> 00:05:55,383
You make a knick and ask, how are you, noble lady?

115
00:05:55,383 --> 00:05:57,183
Say yes, not grandmother to her!

116
00:05:57,183 --> 00:05:58,783
Oh dear, she's coming.

118
00:06:05,352 --> 00:06:09,352
How are you, Mrs. Rottenmeier?

119
00:06:09,352 --> 00:06:11,352
It was easy with Peter's grandmother.

120
00:06:11,352 --> 00:06:14,352
It was called grandmother without the word.

121
00:06:16,352 --> 00:06:20,352
Mrs. Gnädige, Mrs. Gnädige, Mrs. Gnädige, Mrs. Gnädige, Mrs. Gnädige, Mrs.
Dingster.

122
00:06:20,352 --> 00:06:23,352
How are you, grandmother? Are you okay?

123
00:06:23,352 --> 00:06:26,352
Thank you, my child. I'm fine. I'm Clara's grandmother.

124
00:06:29,352 --> 00:06:31,352
And if she shouts right away?

125
00:06:33,832 --> 00:06:35,832
Welcome, dear lady.

126
00:06:35,832 --> 00:06:37,832
Yes, welcome.

127
00:06:46,832 --> 00:06:48,832
Miss Rottenmeier, come to yourself.

128
00:06:48,832 --> 00:06:50,832
What's wrong with her?

129
00:06:50,832 --> 00:06:52,832
Her nerves don't seem to be all right.

130
00:06:53,832 --> 00:06:55,832
Oh, Miss Sesemann.

131
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:59,832
I'm sorry, Miss Rottenmeier, but how should I know that you are so horrible?

132
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:03,354
I wanted to surprise Clara and the Swiss girl.

133
00:07:03,354 --> 00:07:05,354
I'm afraid I was surprised.

134
00:07:07,054 --> 00:07:10,854
Well, what do you say about my bear? Doesn't he look very natural?

135
00:07:11,654 --> 00:07:13,954
Oh, he looks terribly natural.

136
00:07:13,954 --> 00:07:17,854
I'm very happy. It was a pure coincidence that I discovered him.

137
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,654
Let's see what the children will say.

138
00:07:19,654 --> 00:07:20,854
Oh, merciful woman!

139
00:07:20,854 --> 00:07:23,154
You can't do that! Clara is so sensitive!

140
00:07:23,154 --> 00:07:25,054
Where did she drive him?

141
00:07:25,054 --> 00:07:29,054
We were passing by a circus and she lent it to him.

142
00:07:29,054 --> 00:07:30,354
That looks like her.

143
00:07:30,382 --> 00:07:34,382
I won't forget the face of Mrs. Rottenmeier so quickly.

144
00:07:38,382 --> 00:07:42,382
Mrs. Sesemann, fair lady, think of your health.

145
00:07:43,382 --> 00:07:45,382
I'll take care of her.

146
00:07:49,382 --> 00:07:50,382
Come in.

147
00:07:53,382 --> 00:07:55,176
Oh, great mother!

148
00:07:55,176 --> 00:07:58,976
I hate you. I'm a big, evil bear.

149
00:08:00,176 --> 00:08:01,976
You'll taste good.

150
00:08:01,976 --> 00:08:03,976
Honey would taste much better for you.

151
00:08:03,976 --> 00:08:07,976
But you must have eaten honey for breakfast this morning.

152
00:08:08,976 --> 00:08:10,476
Dear grandmother.

153
00:08:11,176 --> 00:08:12,976
Did you at least get scared?

154
00:08:12,976 --> 00:08:15,976
No, not a little bit. I knew right away that it was you.

155
00:08:15,976 --> 00:08:17,976
You look funny.

156
00:08:17,976 --> 00:08:21,376
Funny? I look great here.

157
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:22,376
Yes.

158
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:23,376
Yes?

159
00:08:25,176 --> 00:08:25,710
Yes.

160
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:29,210
You look good, Clara. Much better than I feared.

161
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,210
I'm happy about it.

162
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,210
It's good that you're here.

163
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,210
Let me hug you, my child.

164
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:46,624
Where is the little girl from Switzerland?

165
00:08:46,624 --> 00:08:50,624
What do you think, Clara, if we both surprise her with the bear costume?

166
00:08:50,624 --> 00:08:52,624
Oh yes!

167
00:08:52,624 --> 00:08:55,624
I'm sure I'm the first grandmother for her who looks like a bear.

168
00:08:55,624 --> 00:08:57,624
I'm curious what she says.

169
00:08:57,624 --> 00:08:59,624
And you have to hum loudly.

170
00:08:59,624 --> 00:09:02,624
You'll be surprised how beautifully I hum.

171
00:09:04,624 --> 00:09:08,624
No, not! You can't push the cart yourself!

172
00:09:08,624 --> 00:09:10,624
Sebastian, quick, Sebastian!

173
00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:14,209
Look, I'll take the cart for you, but I can do that myself.

174
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:16,209
It's way too heavy for you.

175
00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:19,209
Poor lady, poor lady Moosmother.

I'm the big bear.

00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:48,767
Run away from me.

180
00:09:52,767 --> 00:09:54,767
Wait, I'll catch you.

181
00:09:55,767 --> 00:09:57,767
I'm faster than you.

182
00:09:57,767 --> 00:09:59,767
I like Swiss girls.

183
00:10:10,767 --> 00:10:13,767
I'm the big bear.

184
00:10:14,719 --> 00:10:16,719
I'm a big, evil bear!

185
00:10:16,719 --> 00:10:18,719
Not even Heidi is afraid!

186
00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:22,719
What? You're not afraid?

187
00:10:22,719 --> 00:10:24,719
And I tried so hard to scare you!

188
00:10:37,567 --> 00:10:39,567
Hello, dear grandmother.

189
00:10:39,567 --> 00:10:40,867
Hello, little Heidi.

190
00:10:40,867 --> 00:10:42,267
Adelheid, what's wrong with you?

191
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:45,267
How many times do I have to tell you how you've grown up?

192
00:10:45,267 --> 00:10:48,267
Show me what I've taught you.

193
00:10:48,267 --> 00:10:51,267
It's not necessary. We've both already met.

194
00:10:51,267 --> 00:10:55,267
I practiced with Adelheid this morning and I want her to stick to it.

195
00:10:55,267 --> 00:10:59,567
I'm sorry I have to contradict you, but I can't give in on this point.

196
00:10:59,567 --> 00:11:02,767
I don't want to interfere with your education, of course.

197
00:11:02,767 --> 00:11:04,567
I'd be happy to.

198
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:07,067
All right, Adelheid. Let's start over.

199
00:11:07,093 --> 00:11:13,093
How are you, Mrs. Gnädige?

200
00:11:13,093 --> 00:11:14,093
Mrs. Gnädige?

201
00:11:14,093 --> 00:11:19,093
All the trouble for free.

202
00:11:19,093 --> 00:11:22,093
Do you say Mrs. Gnädige at home in the mountains?

203
00:11:22,093 --> 00:11:24,093
No, of course not. Nobody says that.

204
00:11:24,093 --> 00:11:27,093
And neither do we. I've never heard it before.

205
00:11:27,093 --> 00:11:29,093
What is it, Adelheid? You know it.

206
00:11:29,093 --> 00:11:33,669
It's good. If you want, I'm the grandmother for you.

207
00:11:33,669 --> 00:11:36,669
But of course I want to, and I'd love to.

208
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:40,669
And now it's your turn to introduce yourself. I have to know your name.

209
00:11:40,669 --> 00:11:43,669
My name is Heidi. But...

210
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:45,669
maybe my name is Adelheid.

211
00:11:45,669 --> 00:11:48,669
Do you have two names? Or should I choose the one I like?

212
00:11:48,669 --> 00:11:51,669
I can explain that to you if you allow me.

213
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,669
She calls herself Heidi. Her correct name is Adelheid.

214
00:11:54,669 --> 00:11:57,669
Oh, so that's how it is. She calls herself Heidi.

215
00:11:57,669 --> 00:12:00,669
Well, then she seems to be used to that name.

216
00:12:00,812 --> 00:12:02,812
Hello Heidi, how are you?

217
00:12:02,812 --> 00:12:04,812
Thank you, I'm very well.

218
00:12:12,918 --> 00:12:16,918
Mrs. Clara, I have to report that Mr. Candidate is waiting.

219
00:12:16,918 --> 00:12:18,918
Do we have to learn today, too?

220
00:12:18,918 --> 00:12:20,918
Why should we make an exception today?

221
00:12:20,918 --> 00:12:23,918
Because today is an exception. The grandmother came.

222
00:12:23,918 --> 00:12:26,918
And this grandmother doesn't run away that fast.

223
00:12:26,918 --> 00:12:28,918
I'd like to take part in the class.

224
00:12:28,918 --> 00:12:31,918
I'd like to see what progress has been made.

225
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,918
You have nothing against it, Mrs. Rottenmeier.

226
00:12:34,918 --> 00:12:36,908
What? Why? Why? Why?

227
00:12:36,908 --> 00:12:41,408
Sebastian, please give the Bärenfeld to Johann. He should return it to the
circus.

228
00:12:41,408 --> 00:12:43,408
Yes, dear lady.

229
00:12:44,408 --> 00:12:46,408
Come in.

230
00:12:46,408 --> 00:12:48,408
Good day.

231
00:12:49,408 --> 00:12:55,408
Oh, what a pleasant surprise to be able to welcome you here again, Mrs.
Sesemann.

232
00:12:58,408 --> 00:13:04,300
You were no longer three, or no, two, maybe just one year no longer here.

233
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,740
Yes, yes, that's how you notice how time goes by, you don't get any younger.

234
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,060
The eyes don't want to be like that anymore, and the legs don't want to...

235
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,420
That's good, Mr. Candidate.

236
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:16,060
We can chat a little later, now we just want to start with the lesson.

237
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,060
Yes, yes, I understand.

238
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:22,380
Adelheid, please tell us the alphabet, we also want to show Mrs. Sesemann what
you learned here.

239
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:30,780
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, uh, and then...

240
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,980
A, B, C, D, E...

241
00:13:34,012 --> 00:13:50,572
...F, G, and H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, and Z.

242
00:13:54,172 --> 00:13:55,772
And once again.

243
00:13:56,252 --> 00:14:00,332
A, B, C, D, E, F...

244
00:14:00,412 --> 00:14:24,412
G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, L, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z, A, B, C, D, E, F, G,
H...

246
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:38,510
Mrs. Rottenmeier wishes that I draw your attention to the fact that we only eat
at 7 o'clock according to the house rules.

247
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:42,510
What? Only at 7 o'clock? But then we have to wait another half hour.

248
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:45,510
We will have to change that. I want to eat earlier.

249
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:50,510
What I wanted to ask is, are you still that bad or do you have more appetite,
Clara?

250
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:55,510
But how are you supposed to get big and strong if you don't want to eat?

251
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:58,510
I don't like eating. I find eating terribly boring.

252
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,508
What is it?

253
00:14:59,508 --> 00:15:02,708
Since when is eating boring? It always tastes good to me.

254
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:07,708
I think it's nice to sit at the table, especially when there's something on the
plate that I like.

255
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:13,708
What do you think you can do with plates?

256
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:17,708
If they're really blank, you can sometimes even look into them.

257
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:24,708
You can also fill the plate with water and let little ships swim on it.

258
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:27,708
And you can even conjure with very deep plates.

259
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:28,851
Conjure?

260
00:15:28,851 --> 00:15:30,151
Conjure?

261
00:15:30,151 --> 00:15:31,151
Sebastian?

262
00:15:31,151 --> 00:15:32,651
Yes, what do you want?

263
00:15:32,651 --> 00:15:35,651
Please be so kind and get me an even deeper plate.

264
00:15:35,651 --> 00:15:37,651
These are the deepest plates we have.

265
00:15:37,651 --> 00:15:40,151
Then get me glasses. Glasses work too.

266
00:15:40,151 --> 00:15:43,651
Glasses, yes. I will hurry, dear lady.

267
00:15:49,869 --> 00:15:51,869
I brought some water.

268
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:53,869
That's good, Sebastian.

269
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:57,869
I think these glasses are real magic glasses.

270
00:16:07,661 --> 00:16:10,661
What are you doing with that, Grandmother Waste?

271
00:16:10,661 --> 00:16:13,661
Just patience. You'll see.

272
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:29,361
Oh, a colorful flower!

273
00:16:30,661 --> 00:16:32,661
You can do magic, Grandmother.

274
00:16:33,861 --> 00:16:36,861
But that's not all you can do with glasses.

275
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:38,361
Just wait a moment.

276
00:16:44,397 --> 00:16:47,397
This seems to be a bit hoarse.

277
00:16:53,397 --> 00:16:54,381
Oh, the ringtone!

278
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:56,381
You can make music!

279
00:16:59,381 --> 00:17:00,381
Well?

280
00:17:08,381 --> 00:17:09,381
That's...

281
00:17:09,517 --> 00:17:11,517
It's the melody by Henzinglein.

282
00:17:11,517 --> 00:17:14,517
If you've recognized it, then you can play it with me.

283
00:17:14,517 --> 00:17:16,517
Gladly. But with what?

284
00:17:16,517 --> 00:17:19,517
There will probably be more glasses.

285
00:17:19,517 --> 00:17:21,517
Sebastian, are there still a few glasses in the house?

286
00:17:29,869 --> 00:17:33,869
Well, let's give it a try together. One, two...

287
00:17:35,617 --> 00:17:36,617
Beautiful!

288
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:56,617
Good!

291
00:18:13,188 --> 00:18:17,188
Since when do you stand on the chair? Do you only have nonsense in your head?

292
00:18:17,188 --> 00:18:19,188
Listen to this, Mrs. Rottenmeier.

293
00:18:19,188 --> 00:18:22,188
I happened to have the nonsense in my head.

294
00:18:22,188 --> 00:18:25,188
Mrs. Seselmann, that can't be true.

295
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:27,188
Oh yes, Mrs. Rottenmeier, that can be true.

296
00:18:27,188 --> 00:18:33,188
And you can't even imagine what fun it is to make music with a simple spoon and
glasses.

297
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:45,188
Stop it! Right now!

298
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,540
I don't want to listen to music.

299
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,540
I'll listen if I want to.

300
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,540
It's time for dinner. It's seven o'clock.

301
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:55,540
If that's the case, we really have to stop now.

302
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,540
I'm almost starved anyway.

303
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:07,434
It's nice with your grandmother. You were right, Clara. She's really very nice.

304
00:19:07,434 --> 00:19:11,434
I like her very, very much. She's always like that. She always comes up with
something funny.

305
00:19:11,434 --> 00:19:14,434
I envy you. You have the best grandmother in the world.

306
00:19:14,434 --> 00:19:15,434
She's yours now.

307
00:19:15,434 --> 00:19:20,434
Do you know what I noticed? You haven't thought about the mountains today.

308
00:19:21,434 --> 00:19:24,434
Yes, that's right. Why do you know that?

309
00:19:24,434 --> 00:19:27,434
I read it from your face.

310
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:30,434
There are letters on it.

311
00:19:30,434 --> 00:19:32,434
So, Clara!

312
00:19:36,106 --> 00:19:41,106
Go to your room, Heidi. Otherwise Mrs. Rottenmeier will find you here and curse
at you again.

313
00:19:42,106 --> 00:19:46,106
Adelaide, what are you doing in Mrs. Clara's room? Get out!

314
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:50,106
Good night, Clara.

315
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,106
Good night, Heidi.

316
00:19:58,052 --> 00:19:59,852
But, but, that's not possible.

317
00:19:59,852 --> 00:20:01,352
Do you think I'm lying to you?

318
00:20:01,352 --> 00:20:03,052
No, no, of course not.

319
00:20:03,052 --> 00:20:04,752
Then go and do what I tell you.

320
00:20:04,752 --> 00:20:07,252
Mrs. Sesemann won't stay long, she's leaving soon.

321
00:20:07,252 --> 00:20:09,052
Yes, very well, I understand.

322
00:20:09,052 --> 00:20:10,052
It will be done.

323
00:20:21,852 --> 00:20:25,252
La, la, la, la, la, la.

324
00:20:25,252 --> 00:20:29,252
La la la la la la la la.

325
00:20:30,252 --> 00:20:33,252
The grandmother is really very funny.

326
00:20:38,252 --> 00:20:39,252
Who's there?

327
00:20:39,252 --> 00:20:40,252
It's me.

328
00:20:40,252 --> 00:20:41,252
Pssst!

329
00:20:44,964 --> 00:20:46,964
Hello, Grandmother.

330
00:20:46,964 --> 00:20:48,964
Can I come in?

331
00:20:48,964 --> 00:20:49,964
Of course.

332
00:20:49,964 --> 00:20:53,964
We have to be quiet, otherwise Mrs. Rottenmeier will hear us and will scold us
again.

333
00:20:53,964 --> 00:20:55,964
Tell me, why haven't you gone to sleep yet?

334
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:57,964
Can you fall asleep already?

335
00:20:57,964 --> 00:20:58,964
No.

336
00:20:58,964 --> 00:21:01,964
I have something for you that I wanted to give you.

337
00:21:01,964 --> 00:21:03,964
A present?

338
00:21:03,964 --> 00:21:05,964
This one.

339
00:21:07,964 --> 00:21:08,964
Don't you like it?

340
00:21:08,964 --> 00:21:10,881
Yes, I even like it very much.

341
00:21:10,881 --> 00:21:12,481
But I can't read it yet.

342
00:21:12,481 --> 00:21:15,181
That's not a problem. There are some nice pictures to look at.

343
00:21:15,181 --> 00:21:16,681
Take a look.

344
00:21:16,681 --> 00:21:19,481
Maybe you'll learn how to read with this book.

345
00:21:19,481 --> 00:21:22,481
It's not as hard as you think it is.

346
00:21:25,481 --> 00:21:27,081
Should I read you some of it?

347
00:21:27,081 --> 00:21:27,881
Oh, yes.

348
00:21:27,881 --> 00:21:29,781
Then hurry up and go to bed, Heidi.

349
00:21:29,781 --> 00:21:32,481
I'll read you so long until your eyes close.

350
00:21:32,481 --> 00:21:34,081
Hooray!

351
00:21:37,181 --> 00:21:39,281
I'm done.

352
00:21:39,345 --> 00:21:41,345
You, grandmother?

353
00:21:41,345 --> 00:21:42,345
What is it, my child?

354
00:21:42,345 --> 00:21:45,345
Miss Rottenmeier says you're leaving soon.

355
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,345
Does she say that?

356
00:21:47,345 --> 00:21:50,345
Yes, she said it to Sebastian this evening.

357
00:21:50,345 --> 00:21:54,345
I'm still here and I don't plan to leave so soon.

358
00:21:54,345 --> 00:21:56,345
Ah, that's nice.

359
00:21:56,345 --> 00:21:58,345
Are you ready? Can I start?

360
00:21:58,345 --> 00:21:59,345
Yes.

361
00:22:00,345 --> 00:22:06,345
Once upon a time in a distant land, far behind the seven mountains,

362
00:22:06,345 --> 00:22:08,065
there lived a little girl.

363
00:22:08,065 --> 00:22:12,565
Grandmother read and read, and Heidi listened attentively.

364
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:15,565
Grandmother had to read three long fairy tales,

365
00:22:15,565 --> 00:22:20,565
until Heidi could no longer keep her eyes open and fell asleep.

366
00:22:20,565 --> 00:22:22,565
Finally!

367
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:41,065

368
00:22:50,459 --> 00:22:56,459
Heidi had been loved by her grandmother from the bottom of her heart, and Mrs.
Sesermann also liked the little girl.

369
00:22:56,459 --> 00:23:00,459
She spent a lot of time teaching Heidi how to read and write.

370
00:23:00,459 --> 00:23:07,459
And then one day, by chance, she came to the secret of why Heidi was sometimes
so sad.

371
00:23:07,459 --> 00:23:11,459
She understood that Heidi was having a heart attack.

372
00:23:11,459 --> 00:23:18,459
To make Klara happy and to comfort Heidi, she thought it would be a surprise for
the children.

373
00:23:18,785 --> 00:23:27,285
She went with them on a warm spring day out to the country, but we want to tell
you about that in our next story.

374
00:23:48,785 --> 00:23:50,785
