00:01:20,762 --> 00:01:30,762
The summer was nearing its end, the first cold autumn winds colored the leaves
and on the mountain tops individual snow caps announced the winter.

2
00:01:52,954 --> 00:01:54,954
Babe, where did you hide?

3
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,570
Have you seen Piep? He didn't wake me up this morning.

4
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,570
If you have no idea where he is, I haven't seen him this morning.

5
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:13,570
Peter? Have you seen my bird anywhere?

6
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:14,570
No.

7
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:15,570
Neither have you.

8
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,570
Why should I have seen him?

9
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,570
Piep didn't wake me up this morning for the first time.

10
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:24,570
Oh, you must have slept so hard today that he didn't wake you up.

11
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:27,570
He must have tried. Don't worry.

12
00:03:02,226 --> 00:03:04,226
You don't look sad.

13
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:06,226
I can't find Piep anymore.

14
00:03:06,226 --> 00:03:08,226
I see.

15
00:03:15,474 --> 00:03:19,474
He comes here every morning. Do you think Falke might have caught him?

16
00:03:19,474 --> 00:03:23,474
No, I don't think so. There must be a very simple explanation for that.

17
00:03:26,474 --> 00:03:30,474
Why don't you play with it? You can build something with it.

18
00:03:31,474 --> 00:03:34,474
Try it. It'll get you thinking differently.

19
00:03:35,474 --> 00:03:38,474
I'll build a house with it. Thank you.

20
00:03:40,474 --> 00:03:42,474
What do you have?

21
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,450
I think I heard a beep.

22
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,450
A beep?

23
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,450
Oh, what a pity. That's not a beep.

24
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,450
So it's gone.

25
00:04:04,882 --> 00:04:08,242
Finally! You don't believe what kind of fear I had for you.

26
00:04:08,242 --> 00:04:11,122
Because you weren't there, I fell asleep for the first time today.

27
00:04:11,122 --> 00:04:13,442
Oh, what did I do to you?

28
00:04:13,442 --> 00:04:16,542
Peep! Where are you flying to, Peep?

29
00:04:21,042 --> 00:04:24,042
I don't understand. What's going on?

30
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,930
Come on!

31
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,690
Wake up!

32
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,930
What are you saying?

33
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:21,310
What is it?

34
00:05:25,778 --> 00:05:27,778
I don't understand.

36
00:06:18,474 --> 00:06:21,474
I'm afraid I'll have to send Josef back.

37
00:06:22,474 --> 00:06:24,474
Josef!

38
00:07:34,186 --> 00:07:36,186
Joseph, why are you here?

39
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:53,130
Pee flew away this morning and I don't know why.

40
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:57,130
Why? I don't know what I did wrong.

41
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:03,130
He met other birds and they took him with them.

42
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:09,130
You're probably always tired.

43
00:08:13,898 --> 00:08:16,898
Come with me, we're going back to the grandfather.

44
00:08:30,474 --> 00:08:33,074
Tell me, did you run away from Peter again?

45
00:08:34,474 --> 00:08:37,074
Snuggie! Don't yell at her like that!

46
00:08:37,074 --> 00:08:38,274
She deserved it.

47
00:08:38,274 --> 00:08:39,474
Why?

48
00:08:39,474 --> 00:08:40,474
That's why.

49
00:08:40,474 --> 00:08:43,974
I can't stand that she runs away without interruption.

50
00:08:43,974 --> 00:08:45,474
She heard me.

51
00:08:45,474 --> 00:08:48,474
Well, usually she runs away for no reason.

52
00:08:48,474 --> 00:08:49,974
Just because she wants to.

53
00:08:49,974 --> 00:08:51,474
You're going home pretty early today.

54
00:08:51,474 --> 00:08:52,474
I know.

55
00:08:52,474 --> 00:08:54,474
Do you want to come with me today?

56
00:08:55,474 --> 00:08:56,474
No.

57
00:08:56,474 --> 00:08:57,474
I can't.

58
00:08:57,474 --> 00:08:58,632
Tomorrow is our birthday.

59
00:08:58,632 --> 00:09:01,232
Our little bird flew away, Peter.

60
00:09:01,232 --> 00:09:04,832
I don't believe that. He'll come back at some point. No excitement.

61
00:09:04,832 --> 00:09:06,592
What do you mean, no excitement?

62
00:09:06,592 --> 00:09:09,272
Piep was my best friend and now he's gone.

63
00:09:09,272 --> 00:09:11,352
If he was your best friend, he'll come back.

64
00:09:11,352 --> 00:09:12,672
You're mean!

65
00:09:12,672 --> 00:09:14,832
Can't you just leave me alone?

66
00:09:14,832 --> 00:09:16,672
Yes, if you don't give me anything to eat.

67
00:09:16,672 --> 00:09:18,872
Don't you ever think of anything else?

68
00:09:18,872 --> 00:09:20,232
Sometimes I'm thirsty.

69
00:09:20,232 --> 00:09:21,192
Stop it!

70
00:09:21,192 --> 00:09:23,032
You're really getting on your nerves.

71
00:09:23,032 --> 00:09:25,072
Do you think your bird flew away forever?

72
00:09:25,072 --> 00:09:26,512
Just off and away?

75
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,890
Well, Heidi, have you found your little bird?

76
00:10:11,106 --> 00:10:14,106
You have to understand your bird, Heidi.

77
00:10:15,106 --> 00:10:19,106
What should one be able to understand?

78
00:10:20,106 --> 00:10:23,106
I didn't do anything to him.

79
00:10:23,106 --> 00:10:26,106
Summer is over, we only have autumn.

80
00:10:29,106 --> 00:10:35,106
I know that, but it has nothing to do with the fact that Pete doesn't like me
anymore and has flown away.

81
00:10:35,106 --> 00:10:38,106
Heidi, Heidi, how much more do you have to learn?

82
00:10:38,106 --> 00:10:40,488
Of course autumn has something to do with your bird.

83
00:10:40,488 --> 00:10:43,088
It's getting colder day by day.

84
00:10:43,288 --> 00:10:45,488
Is it too cold for you?

85
00:10:45,688 --> 00:10:48,288
Some birds can't survive in winter.

86
00:10:48,488 --> 00:10:50,688
If snow and ice cover the ground here,

87
00:10:50,888 --> 00:10:53,888
they won't find the food they need.

88
00:10:56,888 --> 00:10:58,888
They have to starve and freeze here.

89
00:10:59,088 --> 00:11:01,888
That's why they join up with large bird flocks

90
00:11:02,088 --> 00:11:04,088
and fly to the south.

91
00:11:05,088 --> 00:11:08,688
I understand what you mean, but do you think they'll come back?

92
00:11:08,888 --> 00:11:09,888
Yes.

93
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,440
Hopefully.

94
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,440
If you're right, they'll come back in the spring, when the sun is warm again.

95
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,440
Tell me, Grandfather, what I've always wanted to ask you.

96
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,640
How is it that some birds live alone?

97
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,440
They're alone.

98
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,840
Falken live alone. And you live alone too.

99
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,840
You know what? You're like the Falken.

100
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,640
I was once alone like the Falken.

101
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,240
You must have forgotten that you're with me now.

102
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,040
Since then, I'm not alone anymore.

103
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,040
And besides, Joseph is still here.

104
00:11:39,512 --> 00:11:46,012
Do you see it now? I'm not a falcon at all. I have you and Joseph with me.

105
00:11:46,012 --> 00:11:49,512
Yes, we are three together with you.

106
00:11:51,512 --> 00:11:56,512
And if we add Schwerinli and Berli, then our world is almost overfilled.

107
00:11:56,512 --> 00:11:58,512
Sometimes Peter also visits us.

108
00:11:58,512 --> 00:12:00,512
Then we are even six.

109
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:02,096
So many.

110
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:07,096
It won't get boring with us in winter. When will it snow?

111
00:12:07,096 --> 00:12:10,096
You seem to have to learn something else. Patience.

112
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:13,096
I know, but you don't believe how difficult this is.

113
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:39,122
- She was so angry at me yesterday. - Nonsense, she's in the cabin, come on.

114
00:12:40,122 --> 00:12:42,122
Did she say that I'm allowed to come?

115
00:12:44,122 --> 00:12:47,122
- Tell me, General Ziegen, since when are you a coward? - I don't know.

116
00:12:58,714 --> 00:13:01,714
Then you can take care of your goats.

117
00:13:08,218 --> 00:13:10,218
All the best and a nice greeting!

118
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:21,466
I should say hello to Peter. Didn't you hear that he was there?

119
00:13:22,466 --> 00:13:24,466
What's going on with you?

120
00:13:24,466 --> 00:13:26,466
I suddenly don't like him anymore.

121
00:13:26,466 --> 00:13:29,466
Oh yes, just like that, out of the blue?

122
00:13:29,466 --> 00:13:33,466
Come with me, we'll go for a walk. I know a very nice spot.

123
00:13:33,466 --> 00:13:35,302
Yes? Did you...

124
00:13:59,834 --> 00:14:03,274
You have to stay here in the mountains this year.

125
00:14:38,842 --> 00:14:41,842
Of course, we don't have a spring anymore.

126
00:14:58,834 --> 00:15:04,654
This stupid Heidi should see where she gets her bird from.

127
00:15:09,234 --> 00:15:11,234
I've never been here.

128
00:15:11,234 --> 00:15:13,234
I don't know this forest at all.

129
00:15:13,234 --> 00:15:15,234
Peter has never come here with me.

130
00:15:15,234 --> 00:15:17,234
Because Peter doesn't know everything.

131
00:15:17,234 --> 00:15:19,234
Where are we going?

132
00:15:19,234 --> 00:15:21,234
Further and deeper into the forest

133
00:15:21,234 --> 00:15:23,234
to the hazelnut bushes.

134
00:15:23,234 --> 00:15:25,234
Are we going to pick them up?

135
00:15:25,234 --> 00:15:27,234
You guessed it. That's why we're going there.

136
00:15:27,234 --> 00:15:29,234
And that's why we have the rucksacks with us.

137
00:15:29,234 --> 00:15:31,234
Does Peter know where the hazelnut bushes are?

138
00:15:31,234 --> 00:15:33,234
No.

139
00:15:33,234 --> 00:15:35,234
And he doesn't have to

140
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,234
because with his appetite he'll eat them all.

141
00:15:56,562 --> 00:15:58,562
It worked!

142
00:16:55,506 --> 00:16:57,506
I'll show you!

143
00:16:57,506 --> 00:16:58,746
Stop!

144
00:16:58,746 --> 00:16:59,746
Stop it!

145
00:16:59,746 --> 00:17:00,746
You'll see!

146
00:17:00,746 --> 00:17:01,746
Eat your grass!

147
00:17:01,746 --> 00:17:02,746
Stop, stay here!

148
00:17:02,746 --> 00:17:03,746
Stop!

149
00:17:03,746 --> 00:17:04,746
Snuggly, leave my seeds!

150
00:17:04,746 --> 00:17:05,746
No, watch out!

151
00:17:05,746 --> 00:17:06,746
You're right!

152
00:17:06,746 --> 00:17:07,746
It's actually your food.

153
00:17:07,746 --> 00:17:08,746
What happened to my food?

154
00:17:08,746 --> 00:17:09,746
You and the animals...

155
00:17:09,746 --> 00:17:10,746
...I'll show you!

156
00:17:10,746 --> 00:17:11,746
What happened?

157
00:17:11,746 --> 00:17:12,746
No, look!

158
00:17:12,746 --> 00:17:13,746
What happened?

159
00:17:13,746 --> 00:17:14,746
What happened?

160
00:17:14,746 --> 00:17:15,746
No, look!

161
00:17:15,746 --> 00:17:16,746
No, look!

162
00:17:16,746 --> 00:17:17,746
You and the animals...

163
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:18,746
...I'll show you!

164
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:19,746
No, look!

165
00:17:19,746 --> 00:17:20,746
What happened?

166
00:17:20,746 --> 00:17:21,746
What happened?

167
00:17:21,746 --> 00:17:22,398
What happened?

168
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:31,530
Eat your grass, Schnucki! That's better for you! 吃你的草, Schnucki! 这比较好!

169
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:33,530
A bird! 一个小鸟!

170
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:35,530
Why are you flying away? 为什么跑掉了?

171
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:37,530
Not again! 再也不!

172
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,530
Oh, what a pity! 哦,可惜!

173
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:01,770
Look, this time I've even collected a whole pair of shirts.

174
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,770
There are so many of them here.

175
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,770
Do you think we can all wear them later?

176
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:08,770
My backpack is big, a lot fits in there.

177
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,770
A few fit in my backpack too.

178
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,770
Give me some, so you don't have to wear them all by yourself.

179
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,770
We have a long way to go.

180
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:18,770
Grandfather, what is that?

181
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,770
There's something hanging over there.

182
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:21,770
Over there, in the bush.

183
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,770
I'll go and get it.

184
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,770
I like this place.

185
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,770
There's so much to eat here.

186
00:18:30,474 --> 00:18:33,474
Pick as much as you want.

187
00:18:33,474 --> 00:18:35,474
They look delicious.

188
00:18:35,474 --> 00:18:36,474
I'll pick them all.

189
00:18:36,474 --> 00:18:39,474
Maybe Peter will open his eyes when I tell him about it tomorrow.

190
00:18:55,826 --> 00:18:57,826
You should be able to see for yourself.

191
00:18:57,826 --> 00:18:58,826
Yes?

192
00:18:59,826 --> 00:19:01,826
The main thing is that it tastes good.

193
00:19:01,826 --> 00:19:03,826
We can wash the face again.

194
00:19:15,018 --> 00:19:17,018
That's one of a kind.

195
00:19:20,018 --> 00:19:21,018
Too bad.

196
00:19:23,018 --> 00:19:28,018
Did a bird fly by? I didn't want that. I wanted to catch a small bird. Then the
trap would have been enough.

197
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:55,306
Dear Joseph, good dog. Peter, good day.

198
00:19:59,626 --> 00:20:02,426
- Good day, Heidi. - Good day.

199
00:20:06,858 --> 00:20:09,858
I brought something with me.

200
00:20:11,858 --> 00:20:13,858
I know, it's not as cute as your old bird.

201
00:20:13,858 --> 00:20:15,858
But I caught it on my own.

202
00:20:15,858 --> 00:20:18,858
But maybe you'll like it.

203
00:20:18,858 --> 00:20:20,858
Look.

204
00:20:20,858 --> 00:20:22,858
Peter.

205
00:20:22,858 --> 00:20:24,858
Show me.

206
00:20:24,858 --> 00:20:26,858
How cute.

207
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:28,858
Thank you, Peter.

208
00:20:28,858 --> 00:20:30,858
I like it very much.

209
00:20:30,858 --> 00:20:32,858
You think so?

210
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:34,742
That makes me happy.

211
00:20:35,306 --> 00:20:37,306
Well, see you tomorrow.

212
00:20:37,306 --> 00:20:39,306
One moment, Peter.

213
00:20:39,306 --> 00:20:40,306
Yes?

214
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:42,306
Please, grandfather, keep it for me.

215
00:20:42,306 --> 00:20:44,306
I picked it myself.

216
00:20:44,306 --> 00:20:46,306
On my own.

217
00:20:46,306 --> 00:20:48,306
All of them? So many at once?

218
00:20:48,306 --> 00:20:50,306
That's not even everything.

219
00:20:50,306 --> 00:20:52,306
Wait.

220
00:20:53,306 --> 00:20:56,306
Take as many as you want. We have enough of them.

221
00:20:56,306 --> 00:20:58,306
Open your bag.

222
00:20:58,306 --> 00:21:04,306
May I really take you, Oehi?

223
00:21:05,762 --> 00:21:10,762
And then I really wanted to tell you about yesterday. I'm sorry.

224
00:21:10,762 --> 00:21:13,762
Me too, somehow.

225
00:21:13,762 --> 00:21:14,762
So see you tomorrow!

226
00:21:14,762 --> 00:21:16,762
Yes, we can definitely see each other tomorrow, Peter!

227
00:21:16,762 --> 00:21:17,762
Goodbye!

228
00:21:17,762 --> 00:21:19,762
Goodbye!

229
00:21:24,354 --> 00:21:26,354
Show him to me, Grandfather!

230
00:21:27,354 --> 00:21:29,354
What a pretty little bird!

231
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:32,354
He feels so soft and warm and has such nice, smooth feathers.

232
00:21:32,354 --> 00:21:34,354
What are you going to do with him?

233
00:21:34,354 --> 00:21:37,354
Do you want to keep him or should I build a cage?

234
00:21:37,354 --> 00:21:39,354
A cage?

235
00:21:39,354 --> 00:21:41,354
You know, we have autumn.

236
00:21:41,354 --> 00:21:45,354
Would you say that this bird also wants to fly in the south?

237
00:21:46,354 --> 00:21:48,354
Yes, Heidi.

238
00:21:48,354 --> 00:21:50,354
Yes, but...

239
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:59,970
He would stay in a cage. But I don't want to have a bird in a cage. Birds have
to be able to fly freely.

240
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:06,970
I'll let you free, little bird. Maybe you'll be able to pet us.

241
00:22:25,474 --> 00:22:27,474
Have a good time.

242
00:22:27,474 --> 00:22:29,474
Goodbye.

243
00:22:45,602 --> 00:22:58,602
Heidi could not forget her little bird so quickly, but after a few weeks it
snowed in the mountains for the first time and that was a whole new exciting
experience for Heidi again.

244
00:22:58,602 --> 00:23:09,602
Snow in the mountains. They snowed all the way to the roof and the almoehi had
to come up with everything possible to pass the time to the impatient Heidi.

245
00:23:09,602 --> 00:23:14,312
When the sun finally came up behind the clouds again,

246
00:23:14,312 --> 00:23:17,312
he showed his guard how to feed the deer,

247
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:21,312
and sometimes Peter also came to them through the snow.

248
00:23:21,312 --> 00:23:24,312
But we'll tell you about that in our next story.
