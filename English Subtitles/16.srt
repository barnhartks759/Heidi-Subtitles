Heidi

Your world are the mountains

00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,910
Heidi

8
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,910
Because up here you are at home

00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,910
Come home

22
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,910
Find your happiness

23
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:18,910
Come back home

24
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:24,570
Summer passed. It became autumn and winter.

25
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,570
And one morning the first thick snowflakes fell.

26
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,570
It snowed all day and all night.

27
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:35,570
And when Heidi got up the next morning, everything was white.

28
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:39,570
Like the year before, she went out regularly to feed the wild animals.

29
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,570
She had not forgotten her friends from last winter.

00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,570
* Music *

31
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,930
Heidi, why are you digging such a deep hole?

32
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,930
That's a secret. I can't tell you yet.

33
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:24,538
It's hot.

34
00:02:24,538 --> 00:02:27,538
Shit, that should be deep enough now.

36
00:02:55,354 --> 00:02:57,554
Oh, that's good. You can't see anything at all.

37
00:02:57,554 --> 00:02:58,654
Nobody will notice anything.

38
00:02:58,654 --> 00:03:00,854
Actually, I really want to know what you're actually doing there.

39
00:03:00,854 --> 00:03:02,354
You'll see that soon.

40
00:03:04,554 --> 00:03:06,854
Joseph, come! Joseph!

41
00:03:16,354 --> 00:03:19,854
Here I am, over here on the hill. Come here!

42
00:03:19,854 --> 00:03:26,354
Come on, one more time! Come closer! Come on!

43
00:03:26,354 --> 00:03:28,354
What is it?

44
00:03:30,354 --> 00:03:31,417
You know what? You're stupid!

45
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:33,417
Terrible boring!

46
00:03:38,745 --> 00:03:40,985
Let's see if we can get you to run after all!

47
00:03:40,985 --> 00:03:42,985
Watch out, Joseph! Catch!

48
00:03:43,429 --> 00:03:45,429
You're even more boring than I thought!

49
00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:21,169
He'll look right through you. Joseph is smarter than you think.

50
00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:25,169
He's not smart at all. He just has a good nose.

51
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:33,169
Good! There comes your father.

52
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:37,169
Good day! Hurry up!

53
00:04:38,617 --> 00:04:41,617
I hope it works this time. Peter won't notice anything.

54
00:04:41,617 --> 00:04:43,617
I'll give him a kiss.

55
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,617
I'm excited to see what kind of face he'll make.

56
00:04:47,617 --> 00:04:49,617
I've got a surprise for you!

57
00:04:49,617 --> 00:04:51,617
Really? Show it to me!

58
00:04:55,617 --> 00:04:57,561
What kind of one?

59
00:04:57,561 --> 00:04:59,861
Huh? I can't see her. Where is she?

60
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:00,961
You have to look for her.

61
00:05:00,961 --> 00:05:03,261
Why do you suddenly look so disappointed?

62
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,761
I don't see her.

63
00:05:04,761 --> 00:05:09,261
I'm not disappointed. I just thought you were curious and weren't just standing
around.

64
00:05:14,873 --> 00:05:17,873
I saw a pebble. You would have liked that one.

65
00:05:17,873 --> 00:05:19,873
No, a pebble down here?

66
00:05:19,873 --> 00:05:21,873
Do you think it's still somewhere?

67
00:05:21,873 --> 00:05:23,873
Come on, let's go look for it.

68
00:05:25,873 --> 00:05:27,873
Oh no!

69
00:05:28,857 --> 00:05:32,857
Yes, that's right. Anyone who digs a pit falls into it himself.

70
00:05:37,857 --> 00:05:39,857
Was that a surprise?

71
00:05:44,857 --> 00:05:46,617
Will you come with us? We can go with the sleigh.

72
00:05:46,617 --> 00:05:49,617
Oh yes. May I, Grandfather? Yes?

73
00:05:49,617 --> 00:05:51,617
Yes, of course. Why not?

74
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:54,617
Thank you. But I have something.

75
00:05:58,617 --> 00:06:01,617
The teacher put the letter in my pocket earlier.

76
00:06:01,617 --> 00:06:03,617
He said I should definitely hand it over.

77
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:08,617
Goodbye!

78
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:12,912
Stay at home before it gets dark!

79
00:06:32,216 --> 00:06:36,216
It was an important letter, the letter from the schoolteacher from Dörfli.

80
00:06:36,216 --> 00:06:48,216
He had calculated how old Heidi would have to be by now and now wrote to the
Alm-Öhi that it was time to send Heidi to school so that she could read and
write.

81
00:06:48,772 --> 00:06:50,772
* Music *

82
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:23,772
That's way too slow. Can you go faster? Or should I go faster?

83
00:07:29,772 --> 00:07:32,772
Don't be afraid. I'm going to the curve.

84
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,400
There's the child again, our Heidi. I recognize her voice.

85
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,400
No, don't throw snowballs!

86
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,400
Leave it!

87
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,400
She sounds so happy.

88
00:07:43,204 --> 00:07:50,204
7, 9, 10! I'm coming! I know where you are!

89
00:08:13,204 --> 00:08:20,204
Is that a beautiful bell? There it is!

90
00:08:22,204 --> 00:08:27,204
Found it! You're on it! You, Peter?

91
00:08:27,928 --> 00:08:29,928
Who heard the bell?

92
00:08:29,928 --> 00:08:31,928
Oh, my father should have heard it.

93
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,928
He also heard it once, just like me today.

94
00:08:35,928 --> 00:08:37,928
Do you think we can start something with you?

95
00:08:37,928 --> 00:08:40,928
Maybe we can hang it around our Snooki next summer.

96
00:08:40,928 --> 00:08:42,928
Look!

97
00:08:46,264 --> 00:08:50,264
What do you think if we hang the bell around his neck?

98
00:08:50,884 --> 00:09:02,884
That's even more fun!

99
00:09:20,884 --> 00:09:21,884
Come on!

100
00:09:41,884 --> 00:09:42,884
Why are you holding on?

101
00:09:42,884 --> 00:09:43,863
We're way too far away.

102
00:09:43,863 --> 00:09:47,863
That doesn't matter. We have to go back before it gets dark.

103
00:09:47,863 --> 00:09:50,863
And over there is Dörfli. The bells are ringing.

104
00:09:50,863 --> 00:09:52,863
Yes, the bells.

105
00:09:56,567 --> 00:09:58,567
You know what? I've got an idea.

106
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:01,567
What do you think about going all the way down there and visiting Snuggie?

107
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:02,567
Nothing.

108
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:05,567
Why do you always hear the same answer when someone asks you something?

109
00:10:05,567 --> 00:10:07,567
Because you always ask the same stupid questions, of course.

110
00:10:07,567 --> 00:10:09,567
We can't go there now.

111
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,567
If you come home too late, you won't be allowed to come with us tomorrow.

112
00:10:12,567 --> 00:10:14,567
I want to see her.

113
00:10:16,567 --> 00:10:18,567
It will be fine.

114
00:10:18,567 --> 00:10:20,567
She's in the barn and sleeping. So come now.

115
00:10:20,567 --> 00:10:22,567
No, I'm not coming with you. You're coming with me.

116
00:10:22,567 --> 00:10:24,333
Heidi! Wait for me!

117
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:28,333
- Get out! - You're nicer than I thought. Thank you!

118
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:39,559
What was that?

119
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:41,559
Wasn't that Heidi?

120
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:43,559
Of course it was.

121
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,559
Wasn't Peter there?

122
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:47,559
What do they want in the middle of the winter?

123
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:04,471
We're here.

124
00:11:04,471 --> 00:11:06,471
This is your stable?

125
00:11:06,471 --> 00:11:08,471
Do you think she'll recognize us again?

126
00:11:08,471 --> 00:11:10,471
Why not?

127
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:12,471
Come on, let's go in!

128
00:11:14,471 --> 00:11:16,471
It's dark.

129
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:26,951
But he scared me!

130
00:11:27,951 --> 00:11:29,951
Heidi! I found her!

131
00:11:30,951 --> 00:11:31,951
Yes?

132
00:11:35,951 --> 00:11:36,951
Where?

133
00:11:37,367 --> 00:11:39,367
Schnucki, how are you?

134
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,367
Schnuckilein, how are you?

135
00:11:45,367 --> 00:11:47,367
Schnuckilein!

136
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:52,367
You seem to be doing well. You won't be treated badly. You look good.

137
00:11:52,367 --> 00:11:54,367
But you haven't really grown up yet.

138
00:11:54,367 --> 00:11:56,367
Do you give at least a lot of milk?

139
00:11:58,367 --> 00:12:00,367
Let me see.

140
00:12:03,367 --> 00:12:05,020
You look good.

141
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:10,020
Will you promise to grow when we see each other again in spring?

142
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,020
Don't lick me.

143
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:14,020
I think you'll never get used to that.

144
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,020
You know I don't like it when it tickles.

145
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:20,020
You're probably disappointed because I didn't bring you anything.

146
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:23,020
We have to go home. It's getting dark.

147
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,020
Come on.

148
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,020
Hello. Do you remember me?

149
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:32,020
Of course, Heidi. How could I forget you?

150
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,844
Who deserves this pleasant surprise? Me or my goat?

151
00:12:34,844 --> 00:12:37,044
We just wanted to see how Schnucki is doing.

152
00:12:37,044 --> 00:12:40,644
Did you see that? She is healthy and cheerful and gives good milk.

153
00:12:40,644 --> 00:12:42,244
I can only thank you for that.

154
00:12:42,244 --> 00:12:43,644
Will you keep her?

155
00:12:43,644 --> 00:12:45,244
Don't ask such stupid questions.

156
00:12:46,644 --> 00:12:48,844
Goodbye. I have to go now.

157
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,444
Please take good care of her.

158
00:12:52,444 --> 00:12:55,044
But of course. Now don't worry. I'll take care of her.

159
00:12:55,044 --> 00:12:56,044
As always.

160
00:13:00,444 --> 00:13:02,044
A snowball fight.

161
00:13:04,844 --> 00:13:06,844
Yes! Yes!

162
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:10,958
I'll take part in that. I can do that, too!

163
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,958
Oh, no offense!

164
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,958
Throw it away!

165
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:16,790
You won't get it!

166
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:17,790
I'm gonna kill you.

167
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,290
No.

168
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:18,790
I'm gonna kill you.

169
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,290
What?

170
00:13:20,002 --> 00:13:22,002
Throw it! Throw it!

171
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:24,002
There! Ow!

172
00:13:24,002 --> 00:13:26,002
Throw it!

173
00:13:26,002 --> 00:13:28,002
You can't hit it!

174
00:13:28,002 --> 00:13:30,002
Yes! Ow!

175
00:13:30,002 --> 00:13:32,002
That's what you thought!

176
00:13:32,002 --> 00:13:34,002
That's what you thought!

177
00:13:34,002 --> 00:13:36,002
Hit it!

178
00:13:36,002 --> 00:13:38,002
Hit it!

179
00:13:38,002 --> 00:13:40,002
Yes!

180
00:13:40,002 --> 00:13:42,002
Now mine!

181
00:13:42,002 --> 00:13:44,002
Wait, I'm coming!

182
00:13:44,002 --> 00:13:46,002
You have to be faster!

183
00:13:46,002 --> 00:13:48,002
That wasn't anything!

184
00:13:48,002 --> 00:13:50,002
And again!

185
00:13:50,002 --> 00:13:52,002
I'm with you!

186
00:13:52,002 --> 00:13:54,002
Ow!

187
00:13:54,002 --> 00:13:56,002
A bomb!

188
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,002
Yes!

189
00:13:58,002 --> 00:14:00,002
A bomb!

190
00:14:04,002 --> 00:14:06,002
One!

191
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,070
What does she want?

192
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:16,070
Heidi, come with me. It's late!

193
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,070
Why don't you go on?

194
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:23,070
Are you frozen or what?

195
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:27,070
Are you Heidi from the Alp?

196
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,070
Yes, of course I am.

197
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:36,070
Why don't you go to school when you're already down here?

198
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,070
Why me?

199
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:40,684
The teacher gave you a letter. Tell me, did you lose it somewhere?

200
00:14:40,884 --> 00:14:42,284
No, I didn't lose it.

201
00:14:42,484 --> 00:14:45,284
He gave you the letter, but what am I supposed to do in school?

202
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:46,884
Listen to yourself.

203
00:14:47,084 --> 00:14:48,084
What?

204
00:14:48,284 --> 00:14:49,684
Have you ever been to a school?

205
00:14:49,884 --> 00:14:50,884
No, unfortunately not.

206
00:14:51,084 --> 00:14:54,484
Why unfortunately? You can be happy that you didn't have to go to school yet.

207
00:14:55,484 --> 00:14:57,084
Did you know what was in the letter?

208
00:14:57,284 --> 00:14:58,684
No, it was sealed.

209
00:14:58,884 --> 00:15:02,084
Grandfather didn't even tell me that I was allowed to go to school.

210
00:15:02,284 --> 00:15:04,684
That's no wonder. That's not normal.

211
00:15:04,884 --> 00:15:06,084
That's mean.

212
00:15:07,084 --> 00:15:07,669
I'm sorry.

213
00:15:07,669 --> 00:15:09,669
Take it back!

214
00:15:10,669 --> 00:15:11,669
Take it back!

215
00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:13,669
Why should he? Everyone says so.

216
00:15:13,669 --> 00:15:15,669
He lives up in the mountains and it's not normal.

217
00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:17,669
That's no wonder.

218
00:15:17,669 --> 00:15:20,669
He lives up there all alone and doesn't want anything to do with anyone.

219
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,669
That's how it is.

220
00:15:22,669 --> 00:15:24,669
You have no idea.

221
00:15:32,597 --> 00:15:35,597
Doesn't she look strange, too?

222
00:15:35,597 --> 00:15:39,597
Heidi, show us the alphabet, will you?

223
00:15:39,597 --> 00:15:41,597
If you tell me what it is, I'd love to.

224
00:15:49,597 --> 00:15:52,597
She doesn't even know what the alphabet is!

225
00:15:53,173 --> 00:15:57,173
Is the alphabet something funny?

226
00:15:57,173 --> 00:15:59,173
The alphabet?

227
00:15:59,173 --> 00:16:01,173
Well, if you've never heard the alphabet,

228
00:16:01,173 --> 00:16:03,173
then we'll teach you two.

229
00:16:03,173 --> 00:16:04,173
Be quiet! Attention!

230
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:18,173
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, F, Q, R, S

231
00:16:18,173 --> 00:16:19,173
Stop! Stop! Stop!

232
00:16:19,173 --> 00:16:21,173
You might be a teacher!

233
00:16:21,173 --> 00:16:23,173
You're making mistakes!

234
00:16:27,701 --> 00:16:29,701
Why do you need something like that?

235
00:16:29,701 --> 00:16:31,701
That's not possible!

236
00:16:31,701 --> 00:16:33,701
Tell me!

237
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,701
You don't seem to know anything.

238
00:16:35,701 --> 00:16:37,701
It's about time you came to school.

239
00:16:37,701 --> 00:16:39,701
At least I can milk goats.

240
00:16:39,701 --> 00:16:41,701
And that's better than all of us together.

241
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:43,701
Everyone in our village can milk goats.

242
00:16:43,701 --> 00:16:45,701
I can whistle, too.

243
00:16:50,283 --> 00:16:55,083
- I can do that too! - I've never seen such a stupid thing like you!

244
00:16:55,283 --> 00:16:56,483
You should be let go!

245
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:59,083
- Come with me! - You really need the school!

246
00:16:59,283 --> 00:17:01,283
Why are they so close to me?

247
00:17:08,629 --> 00:17:12,629
Why did they laugh at me then? Did I do something to them or did I do something
wrong?

248
00:17:12,629 --> 00:17:17,629
Oh, what? No one has to go to school. They only tell you boring things. Believe
me.

249
00:17:17,629 --> 00:17:18,629
Wait a minute.

250
00:17:20,629 --> 00:17:25,629
So, now everything is fine. Now you can teach me the alphabet. Start with it.

251
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:27,629
What? I should teach you the alphabet?

252
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:28,629
Yes.

253
00:17:29,629 --> 00:17:30,629
I don't know.

254
00:17:31,629 --> 00:17:34,629
Then don't be so slow. Start.

255
00:17:34,629 --> 00:17:37,629
A, B, C, D.

256
00:17:37,675 --> 00:17:46,475
E, F, G, F, G, F, G, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, G, G.

257
00:17:46,475 --> 00:17:48,475
How does it go on? Don't you know?

258
00:17:48,475 --> 00:17:50,475
G, F, G, M.

259
00:17:50,475 --> 00:17:53,475
Oh, why? No one needs the alphabet.

260
00:17:53,475 --> 00:17:56,475
The goats have never asked us for it, have they?

261
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:59,475
So I'm not the only one who doesn't know it yet.

262
00:18:00,475 --> 00:18:02,475
Come on, let's go home.

263
00:18:07,675 --> 00:18:10,675
Subtitles by Stephanie Geiges

264
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,740
Where are the two of them?

265
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,660
But what is he doing?

266
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,660
Is there something new in the village that I don't know yet?

267
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,660
Yes, you can say that. The teacher wrote a letter to the Almühi.

268
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,660
He could have saved himself, he doesn't read.

269
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,660
This time he will have to read whether he likes it or not.

270
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,660
He doesn't care.

271
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,660
No.

272
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,660
You make me curious. What did he write?

273
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,660
Do you know what's in it?

274
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:54,660
I know. He's supposed to send Heidi to school, but he's going to come up with an
excuse again.

275
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,660
My son says she can't even read the alphabet.

276
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,346
Is that a possibility?

277
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:01,946
I'm convinced that she can't even distinguish right from left.

278
00:19:01,946 --> 00:19:04,346
Well, you know what that leads to.

279
00:19:04,346 --> 00:19:08,546
That's not going to end well, because I haven't seen her in the church on Sunday
either.

280
00:19:08,546 --> 00:19:11,046
You can't blame the child for that.

281
00:19:11,082 --> 00:19:13,682
She doesn't go to church herself. How should the little girl know?

282
00:19:13,682 --> 00:19:16,182
You have to be careful that she doesn't even bathe on Saturdays.

283
00:19:16,182 --> 00:19:20,582
My son is bathed every Saturday and scrubbed with soap, whether he wants to or
not.

284
00:19:20,582 --> 00:19:24,582
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. Maybe she even has lice.

285
00:19:24,582 --> 00:19:27,582
That could be good, but I don't think so.

286
00:19:27,582 --> 00:19:30,582
My son saw her today and said she was a very pretty girl.

287
00:19:30,582 --> 00:19:31,582
He didn't see lice.

288
00:19:31,582 --> 00:19:34,582
The more important it is that she goes to school.

289
00:19:35,482 --> 00:19:38,982
Yes, yes, yes, yes, but the old man doesn't want to listen to us.

290
00:19:38,982 --> 00:19:40,982
He hasn't greeted me a single time.

291
00:19:40,982 --> 00:19:42,982
Recently I even waved to him.

292
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:44,482
Exactly, that looks like him.

293
00:19:44,482 --> 00:19:46,482
He looks through you as if you were air.

294
00:20:02,482 --> 00:20:04,482
Grandfather, I'm back!

295
00:20:04,482 --> 00:20:06,482
Finally!

296
00:20:06,482 --> 00:20:09,482
I was down in the village and visited Schnucki.

297
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:15,520
- There I am! - You're late, I just put on my coat and wanted to look for you.

298
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,120
I was at Schnucki's.

299
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,520
She's fine and she shouldn't be sold anymore.

300
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,120
Oh, I'm glad to hear that.

301
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,720
Yes, and imagine, she's still giving milk.

302
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,948
That's good for me.

303
00:20:28,948 --> 00:20:31,748
My hands are freezing cold. Show me the letter.

304
00:20:31,748 --> 00:20:36,748
Down in the village, they say, the teacher has written that I can also come to
school now.

305
00:20:37,748 --> 00:20:39,948
So they told you about it?

306
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:43,948
Was that wrong? Why are you so angry all of a sudden?

307
00:20:46,348 --> 00:20:48,948
Why didn't you tell me anything about school?

308
00:20:51,748 --> 00:20:53,948
Because I don't think it's right.

309
00:20:55,948 --> 00:20:57,948
Have you never been to school?

310
00:20:58,281 --> 00:21:02,281
Yes, that's true, but this school is down in the village, and that's something
else.

311
00:21:02,281 --> 00:21:05,781
But there's no other one, and I have to go to school.

312
00:21:05,781 --> 00:21:06,781
You don't.

313
00:21:07,781 --> 00:21:10,281
That's enough, I don't want to hear any more of that.

314
00:21:13,281 --> 00:21:15,281
Why?

315
00:21:22,099 --> 00:21:24,099
Why?

316
00:21:24,099 --> 00:21:27,099
It's a waste of time to go to school.

317
00:21:28,099 --> 00:21:32,099
They teach the children how to write and read, but they also spoil them.

318
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:38,099
They forget to teach the children that there is something more important for
people than letters and numbers.

319
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:42,099
They look at our world in books and no longer know how beautiful it really is.

320
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:45,099
But you still know.

321
00:21:46,099 --> 00:21:48,099
I don't know.

322
00:21:49,811 --> 00:21:54,811
Then you bring me the writing and reading. It's enough for both of us when you
were in school.

323
00:21:56,811 --> 00:21:59,811
I'll make us something to eat. You've been in the fresh air all day.

324
00:22:00,811 --> 00:22:01,811
Good, I'm hungry.

325
00:22:07,091 --> 00:22:14,091
When Heidi then sat at the dinner table with her grandfather, she had long
forgotten the plan to go to school

326
00:22:14,091 --> 00:22:21,091
She told in detail about what she had experienced, about Snooki, about the milk
that Snooki gave and about the snowball battle of course

327
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:29,091
She didn't read anything in her report, not even that she was laughed at by the
village boys and that Peter couldn't read the alphabet

328
00:22:29,091 --> 00:22:36,091
She told about the big sled and the cow bell and claimed that they would have
been faster than the wind

329
00:22:37,091 --> 00:22:43,091
The End

330
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:51,795
When the snow melted and it became spring, Heidi and Joseph ran across the
meadows every day and looked for new adventures.

331
00:22:51,795 --> 00:22:56,795
And on one of these trains they both experienced a surprise.

332
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:00,795
Watch out, he's flying far!

333
00:23:03,795 --> 00:23:07,795
A stranger man came up to them, whom Heidi had never seen before.

334
00:23:07,795 --> 00:23:09,795
What did he want up here?

335
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:18,765
He was friendly to her and spoke for a long time with the grandfather. Heidi was
not allowed to be there when the two were having a conversation, but the
grandfather was very serious.

336
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:22,265
But we want to tell you about this in our next story.

337
00:23:23,007 --> 00:23:52,007
Heidi, Heidi, your world is the mountains, Heidi, Heidi, because up here you are
at home, Heidi, Heidi, come home, find your happiness, come back home.

338
00:23:53,007 --> 00:23:54,360
Thank you for watching.
