Heidi

00:00:24,398 --> 00:00:28,398
Your world are the mountains

5
00:00:28,398 --> 00:00:32,398
Heidi

6
00:00:32,398 --> 00:00:36,398
Because up here you are at home

7
00:00:36,398 --> 00:00:40,398
Dark berries

8
00:00:40,398 --> 00:00:44,398
Green meadows in the sunshine

00:00:44,398 --> 00:00:48,398
Heidi, Heidi

10
00:00:48,398 --> 00:00:52,398
You need to be happy

Heidi, Heidi

15
00:01:10,398 --> 00:01:12,398
Come home

16
00:01:12,398 --> 00:01:14,398
Find your happiness

17
00:01:14,398 --> 00:01:19,398
Come back home

18
00:01:20,762 --> 00:01:28,842
In Egypt, 639 to 641 of the Arabs are conquered, the capital Alexandria 642 and
after a short

19
00:01:28,842 --> 00:01:34,122
retake again 646 of the Byzantines. And imagine, the conquerors

20
00:01:34,122 --> 00:01:38,242
are happily welcomed by the Coptic monophysites. They maintain the old

21
00:01:38,242 --> 00:01:42,542
administrative system, also take over the military camp Babylon Fusatum as
Fustat with

22
00:01:42,542 --> 00:01:50,342
Amrumosche in later Old Cairo. And in the year 658 the nobility is actually
still dreaming.

23
00:01:50,342 --> 00:01:52,342
Tch!

24
00:01:54,746 --> 00:01:57,606
Adulthood, where is your behavior?

25
00:01:57,606 --> 00:01:59,606
Excuse me, Mr. Candidate.

26
00:01:59,606 --> 00:02:00,686
Discipline!

27
00:02:00,686 --> 00:02:06,246
Mr. Candidate tells us the many exciting stories about the ancient Egypt for his
pleasure.

28
00:02:06,246 --> 00:02:08,246
I want you to learn this by heart.

29
00:02:14,202 --> 00:02:16,202
Egypt? Cairo?

30
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,638
Cairo is a beautiful place.

31
00:02:19,638 --> 00:02:21,638
Cairo is a beautiful place.

32
00:02:39,638 --> 00:02:41,638
grandfather, grandfather

33
00:02:47,638 --> 00:02:58,638
Oh, that was here.

34
00:03:03,887 --> 00:03:06,887
I think the old Egyptians are boring.

35
00:03:08,887 --> 00:03:10,887
Do you want to play?

36
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:20,655
My name is Miss Butterfly and I look like an old Egyptian.

37
00:03:20,655 --> 00:03:22,655
Take the wolf, Heidi.

38
00:03:24,655 --> 00:03:25,655
There?

39
00:03:29,935 --> 00:03:33,935
There, Mr. Candidate. He looks very similar to him.

40
00:03:39,087 --> 00:03:43,087
Knock, knock, knock. Adelheid, stop sneezing.

41
00:03:43,087 --> 00:03:45,087
Knock, knock.

42
00:03:47,087 --> 00:03:49,087
What's the matter, Heidi?

43
00:03:52,087 --> 00:03:55,087
Can't you remember the old Egyptians?

44
00:03:56,087 --> 00:03:59,087
I know what you think when you make such a face.

45
00:03:59,087 --> 00:04:02,087
You think of home and the mountains, don't you?

47
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:12,679
What is it? You're so different, Heidi.

48
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:19,679
Aha, in this house everything seems to be mixed up.

49
00:04:19,679 --> 00:04:22,679
Have you forgotten that it's time to eat?

50
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,679
Come on, we have to go.

51
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,679
We have to go.

52
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,759
I don't need them.

53
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,759
But these are all clothes that used to belong to me.

54
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,759
They are hardly worn.

55
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,759
Yes, you can see that.

56
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:04,759
Then take them.

57
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:08,759
When I go to the pasture with Peter and the goats, you can't wear something like
that.

58
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:09,759
Heidi.

59
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,759
You can't play well in such clothes.

60
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,759
But Heidi, you don't really want to go away.

61
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,215
No, I can't.

62
00:05:23,215 --> 00:05:27,215
No, no, no! I won't let that happen! You just can't leave me alone!

63
00:05:27,215 --> 00:05:28,215
I have to.

64
00:05:28,215 --> 00:05:30,215
But we're friends after all.

65
00:05:30,215 --> 00:05:34,215
You said you'd stay with me. What am I supposed to do if you leave?

66
00:05:34,215 --> 00:05:37,215
Then I'll write to my father that he forbids it!

67
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:44,215
No, I don't want to be alone anymore.

68
00:05:44,215 --> 00:05:48,215
I don't know what to do either. I want to go back to the mountains.

69
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:52,215
We can go to the forest together, like we did with Grandma.

70
00:05:52,517 --> 00:05:54,717
Then we'll take a look at the flowers and the trees.

71
00:05:54,717 --> 00:05:55,517
Is that possible?

72
00:05:55,517 --> 00:05:56,817
Why shouldn't that be possible?

73
00:05:56,817 --> 00:05:59,117
We're asking Johann to take us to the carriage.

74
00:05:59,117 --> 00:06:01,517
Maybe then we'll meet your two friends again, yes?

75
00:06:01,517 --> 00:06:02,917
The ones with the butterflies.

76
00:06:02,917 --> 00:06:04,717
Or even better, you're going alone.

77
00:06:17,732 --> 00:06:19,732
Did you get a call for me?

78
00:06:19,732 --> 00:06:21,732
Yes, come in.

79
00:06:35,588 --> 00:06:37,588
Please read it to me.

80
00:06:37,588 --> 00:06:39,588
This is something very unusual.

81
00:06:39,588 --> 00:06:40,588
Why unusual?

82
00:06:40,588 --> 00:06:43,588
Because you have never asked me for it.

83
00:06:43,588 --> 00:06:45,588
I'm just a little tired.

84
00:06:45,588 --> 00:06:47,588
Then you should lie down for a moment and rest.

85
00:06:47,588 --> 00:06:49,588
No, I don't feel like it.

86
00:06:49,588 --> 00:06:51,588
The book is ugly.

87
00:06:51,588 --> 00:06:53,588
Still unusual.

88
00:06:53,588 --> 00:06:54,588
Well, fine.

89
00:06:54,588 --> 00:06:57,588
639 to 661

90
00:06:57,588 --> 00:06:59,588
Egypt is conquered by the Arabs.

91
00:06:59,588 --> 00:07:03,588
The capital Alexandria 642 and

92
00:07:05,588 --> 00:07:06,148
Ancient Egypt

93
00:07:06,148 --> 00:07:10,148
I would call this book interesting, but not particularly pretty.

94
00:07:21,148 --> 00:07:23,148
Heidi! Stay here!

95
00:07:23,148 --> 00:07:24,148
No!

96
00:07:24,324 --> 00:07:26,324
Do you want to run away again?

97
00:07:26,324 --> 00:07:28,324
Let me go! Let me run!

98
00:07:28,324 --> 00:07:30,324
Be quiet! You'll come home right away!

99
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:33,324
Please no! I just want to pick some flowers!

100
00:07:33,324 --> 00:07:36,324
You don't want to pick flowers?

101
00:07:36,324 --> 00:07:39,324
You want to run away again, that's all!

102
00:07:39,324 --> 00:07:41,324
You're heavy! Don't pull me like that!

103
00:07:41,324 --> 00:07:43,324
I want to catch a squirrel and pick flowers!

104
00:07:43,324 --> 00:07:45,324
Come in!

105
00:07:47,324 --> 00:07:49,324
You're mean! I didn't do anything at all!

106
00:07:49,324 --> 00:07:52,324
I just wanted to go for a walk!

107
00:07:52,324 --> 00:07:54,324
You're mean all the time!

108
00:07:54,628 --> 00:07:57,628
to call a grown-up extremely indecent.

109
00:07:57,628 --> 00:08:00,628
Let Heidi go, Mrs. Rottenmeier.

110
00:08:00,628 --> 00:08:04,628
I don't think about that. She gets her punishment she deserves.

111
00:08:04,628 --> 00:08:07,628
Get in your room, you evil thing.

112
00:08:07,628 --> 00:08:10,628
That wasn't right. Heidi had no fault at all.

113
00:08:10,628 --> 00:08:13,628
I wanted her to pick a few flowers for me.

114
00:08:13,628 --> 00:08:15,628
Thank you very much for the clarification.

115
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,628
But that is now well known to me.

116
00:08:17,628 --> 00:08:20,522
Reading it out was immediately remarkable to me.

117
00:08:20,522 --> 00:08:26,522
Now this monster has done it. She has taught you how to lie and cheat honorable
people.

118
00:08:26,522 --> 00:08:28,522
You should write to your father.

119
00:08:28,522 --> 00:08:32,522
Heidi is not a monster. She is my very, very best friend.

120
00:08:33,522 --> 00:08:35,522
Lady Clara!

121
00:08:39,172 --> 00:08:43,172
What is it? You know that you are not allowed to get upset.

122
00:08:43,172 --> 00:08:48,172
If you keep being like this with Heidi, then she will leave one day and then I
will be alone again.

123
00:08:48,172 --> 00:08:52,172
And I have to be honest, I can even understand if she will leave one day.

124
00:08:52,172 --> 00:08:54,172
Why are you always so mean?

125
00:08:54,172 --> 00:09:00,172
Yes, but Mrs. Clara, do you want to indicate that you like this shop?

126
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:06,172
Yes, I like it. And I can't imagine how it is without you.

127

Of course he disappeared!

Sebastian! Sebastian!

131
00:09:30,877 --> 00:09:32,877
Yes, please.

132
00:09:51,877 --> 00:09:52,877
Let's go!

133
00:09:53,877 --> 00:09:56,877
Peter! Grandfather!

134
00:09:56,877 --> 00:09:58,877
Hurray! Hurray!

135
00:10:04,877 --> 00:10:06,877
Good day, General!

136
00:10:06,877 --> 00:10:08,877
Good day, Peter!

137
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:28,877
I have a reputation....

138
00:10:38,877 --> 00:10:40,877
I am guests...

139
00:10:40,877 --> 00:10:42,877
I have a reputation....

140
00:10:45,877 --> 00:10:47,877
Adelheid!

141
00:10:47,877 --> 00:10:48,281
So, the dent has again....

142
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:54,281
No, I don't think so. She was still closed earlier. I just came by.

143
00:10:54,281 --> 00:10:55,281
Adelaide?

144
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:58,281
Excuse me.

145
00:10:59,281 --> 00:11:03,281
Didn't I send you to your room earlier? What are you looking for here?

146
00:11:04,281 --> 00:11:06,281
This room belongs to Mrs. Sesemann.

147
00:11:06,281 --> 00:11:10,281
Grandmother gave me the key. She brought me here.

148
00:11:10,281 --> 00:11:12,281
Who? Mrs. Sesemann?

149
00:11:13,727 --> 00:11:17,727
You've been standing in front of this horrible old hamster once again.

150
00:11:17,727 --> 00:11:19,727
Forget about these stupid mountains.

151
00:11:19,727 --> 00:11:21,727
You've become a city girl now.

152
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:24,727
No! I'll go home again.

153
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:26,727
That's out of the question.

154
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,727
After all, you're Mrs. Clara's partner.

155
00:11:29,727 --> 00:11:32,727
But it doesn't seem to interest you at all what she thinks.

156
00:11:32,727 --> 00:11:36,727
Don't you feel sorry for the poor Mrs. Clara in her wheelchair?

157
00:11:36,727 --> 00:11:38,727
But...

158
00:11:39,321 --> 00:11:46,321
And since we are talking about this topic right now, I would like to ask you to
never mention your stupid mountains in front of Mrs. Clara.

159
00:11:47,321 --> 00:11:49,321
Not even at Clara's?

160
00:11:51,321 --> 00:11:53,321
Yes, not even there.

161
00:11:54,321 --> 00:11:56,321
Mrs. Clara is very sick.

162
00:11:57,321 --> 00:11:59,321
The doctor strictly forbade her to get upset.

163
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:06,321
Do you understand? You really have no reason to complain and could show a little
more gratitude.

164
00:12:07,321 --> 00:12:08,321
And now come with me.

165
00:12:09,321 --> 00:12:09,594
Yes, I understand.

166
00:12:39,594 --> 00:12:41,594
Grandfather Peter Schnucki.

167
00:13:05,422 --> 00:13:09,422
Now Miss Rottenmeier forbids me to tell you about you.

168
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:11,422
She's mean.

169
00:13:15,422 --> 00:13:16,422
Who's there?

170
00:13:16,422 --> 00:13:19,422
Oh, the wind. At least it's like at home.

171
00:13:21,422 --> 00:13:25,422
Only the tannins. They don't rush in front of my window.

172
00:13:25,422 --> 00:13:29,422
I want to hear and see it all over and over again.

173
00:13:35,422 --> 00:13:38,422
That's how it feels to be the only one.

174
00:13:55,790 --> 00:14:01,790
In autumn there are always storms here, but I'm not even allowed to tell Clara
yet.

175
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,790
I'm not even allowed to tell Clara yet.

176
00:14:27,886 --> 00:14:29,886
What happened? What's going on? What's going on?

177
00:14:29,886 --> 00:14:31,886
Come on, say something.

178
00:14:31,886 --> 00:14:33,886
There's a white ghost on the stairs.

179
00:14:35,886 --> 00:14:36,886
There's no one standing there.

180
00:14:36,886 --> 00:14:37,886
What is it?

181
00:14:37,886 --> 00:14:39,886
Look again, such a big white...

182
00:14:39,886 --> 00:14:41,886
Ah, stop it.

183
00:14:41,886 --> 00:14:44,886
Yes, there it was. Up there on the stairs.

184
00:14:48,886 --> 00:14:51,886
Oh, what? There's a shop opening a window.

185
00:14:51,886 --> 00:14:53,886
You just want to calm me down.

186
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:57,892
I know the sound of the creaking windows. It has nothing to do with it.

187
00:14:57,892 --> 00:15:01,892
I know very well that there was a little white figure going back and forth up
there.

188
00:15:01,892 --> 00:15:02,892
I'm not blind.

189
00:15:07,892 --> 00:15:09,892
I had closed the door earlier.

190
00:15:09,892 --> 00:15:12,892
Maybe you accidentally turned the key the wrong way.

191
00:15:15,892 --> 00:15:16,892
What's going on here?

192
00:15:16,892 --> 00:15:18,892
Well, there you see it, Miss Rottenmeier.

193
00:15:18,892 --> 00:15:21,892
Who else am I supposed to be? A spy, perhaps?

194
00:15:22,809 --> 00:15:26,809
So what's going on? I saw a little white figure up on the stairs.

195
00:15:26,809 --> 00:15:31,809
And if I didn't know there were no more ghosts, I'd say that was one.

196
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,809
I don't have any ghosts in the house.

197
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:37,809
Yeah.

198
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:56,809

199
00:16:01,475 --> 00:16:05,475
Everything seems to be in order here.

200
00:16:06,475 --> 00:16:09,475
Everything is quiet in the study.

201
00:16:18,947 --> 00:16:22,947
You can't have made a fool of yourself. She's asleep.

202
00:16:28,771 --> 00:16:30,771
I can find something somewhere.

203
00:16:30,771 --> 00:16:32,771
Tinette, you must be mistaken.

204
00:16:32,771 --> 00:16:34,771
Oh no, I'm not mistaken.

205
00:16:34,771 --> 00:16:36,771
Then it must be somewhere.

206
00:16:36,771 --> 00:16:38,771
Ghosts sometimes just show up very briefly.

207
00:16:38,771 --> 00:16:40,771
Now stop with the nonsense!

208
00:16:40,771 --> 00:16:42,771
And if it wasn't nonsense?

209
00:16:42,771 --> 00:16:44,771
I swear it to everything that is holy to me.

210
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:46,771
It was on the stairs.

211
00:16:46,771 --> 00:16:48,771
I beg you.

212
00:16:54,771 --> 00:16:56,771
But...

213
00:16:58,771 --> 00:17:00,771
It was on the stairs.

214
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:20,267
Hey Heidi, what was that? Something must have happened, didn't you hear
anything?

215
00:17:21,267 --> 00:17:22,267
Clara?

216
00:17:22,267 --> 00:17:23,267
Yes?

217
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:26,267
The clouds look like white sheep.

218
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,651
White clouds.

219
00:17:33,651 --> 00:17:37,651
I see. You think of your mountains and want to go home.

220
00:17:37,651 --> 00:17:42,651
If I could only imagine how I could keep you here, Heidi.

221
00:17:42,651 --> 00:17:44,651
I can't, after all.

222
00:17:46,651 --> 00:17:49,651
I think of clouds. I didn't think of mountains.

223
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,651
But I saw it in your eyes.

224
00:17:51,651 --> 00:17:53,651
Then you were mistaken.

225
00:18:01,651 --> 00:18:06,651
I want to go home. I want to go back to my grandfather.

226
00:18:17,784 --> 00:18:19,784
Yes?

227
00:18:19,784 --> 00:18:21,784
Why is Mrs. Clara sitting alone in her room?

228
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:24,784
But Adelheid, you seem to have cried.

229
00:18:24,784 --> 00:18:26,784
So you thought about the mountains again.

230
00:18:26,784 --> 00:18:29,784
But child, you can get over it if you want.

231
00:18:29,784 --> 00:18:30,784
I don't think so.

232
00:18:30,784 --> 00:18:32,784
But yes, for sure.

233
00:18:32,784 --> 00:18:37,784
And now a kind little girl wipes your face off and goes to Mrs. Clara's room.

234
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,784
Discipline, my child.

235
00:18:47,784 --> 00:18:57,784
To be continued...

236
00:18:59,784 --> 00:19:00,784
Heidi?

237
00:19:01,784 --> 00:19:02,784
Heidi!

238
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,920
What is it?

239
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,920
Nothing, Clara.

240
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,920
Heidi!

241
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,920
Leave me alone.

242
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,920
Clara, don't even ask me!

243
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,920
Heidi, calm down, please.

244
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,920
Why do you have to cry so much?

245
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,920
Is there anything I can do to help you?

246
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,920
I want to do everything you ask of me.

247
00:19:34,296 --> 00:19:39,296
You can't do anything for me. Just nothing.

248
00:19:43,296 --> 00:19:45,296
But I...

249
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,120
To Wolden.

250
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,520
The drop is not as bad as I thought it would be.

251
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,520
I could get used to this wine.

252
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,520
It's just a pity that the bottle is empty and so is the glass.

253
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,520
I don't know. I can't help myself.

254
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,520
I have such a silly feeling in the stomach area.

255
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,520
What if it wasn't an imitation?

256
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,520
What do you mean by imitation, Sebastian?

257
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,520
Well, the ghost, what else should I mean?

258
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,520
Well, let's do that. We'd rather open another bottle.

259
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,100
We'd rather open another bottle.

260
00:21:05,837 --> 00:21:13,837
Johan, Johan, wake up, it's twelve o'clock.

261
00:21:13,837 --> 00:21:15,837
Oh, so what?

262
00:21:15,837 --> 00:21:17,837
It's midnight, it's ghost hour.

263
00:21:17,837 --> 00:21:19,837
Come on, we're going to catch the guys.

264
00:21:19,837 --> 00:21:21,837
Does that have to be?

265
00:21:23,837 --> 00:21:25,837
Watch out, you're doing the best you can.

266
00:21:32,301 --> 00:21:34,301
What are you waiting for?

267
00:21:34,301 --> 00:21:36,301
Why should I go first?

268
00:21:36,301 --> 00:21:38,301
Because you have the light.

269
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,301
The wind blew out the candles.

270
00:21:44,301 --> 00:21:46,301
Don't be like that.

271
00:21:48,301 --> 00:21:50,301
Don't let it go.

272
00:22:00,589 --> 00:22:02,589
What's going on?

273
00:22:02,589 --> 00:22:04,589
The ghost! I saw the ghost!

274
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:06,589
The ghost is up there!

275
00:22:06,589 --> 00:22:08,589
You mean the network ghost?

276
00:22:08,589 --> 00:22:10,589
Oh!

277
00:22:10,589 --> 00:22:12,589
Psst!

278
00:22:12,589 --> 00:22:14,589
No one there!

279
00:22:16,589 --> 00:22:18,589
There's the door!

280
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:20,589
It's open again!

281
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,589
I think I'm dreaming!

282
00:22:22,589 --> 00:22:24,589
Someone's coming!

283
00:22:30,589 --> 00:22:32,205
The ghost is up there!

284
00:22:32,205 --> 00:22:35,205

285
00:22:49,677 --> 00:22:59,117
The excitement in the house of Sesemann about the alleged ghost was so great
that Fräulein Rottenmeier sent a telegram to Paris and Mr. Sesemann asked to
come back.

286
00:22:59,117 --> 00:23:05,517
Clara's father listened attentively to the reports of his employees, but he also
did not know any explanation.

287
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:08,477
Only the secret council brought him on a trail.

288
00:23:08,477 --> 00:23:16,867
Did the ghost have something to do with the mountains, Heidi and the
grandfather?

289
00:23:16,867 --> 00:23:19,867
But today we don't want to solve the mystery.

290
00:23:19,867 --> 00:23:25,867
We will do that next time when we tell a new story about Heidi.

291
00:23:25,913 --> 00:23:47,273
Heidi, Heidi, your world is the mountains, Heidi, Heidi, because up here you are
at home, Heidi, Heidi.

292
00:23:47,273 --> 00:23:57,273
Heidi, come home, find your happiness, come back home.
