Find your happiness

17
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:18,430
Come back at last

18
00:01:36,314 --> 00:01:37,314
Good morning, Clara.

19
00:01:37,314 --> 00:01:39,314
You slept a long time today.

20
00:01:39,314 --> 00:01:42,314
We came to bed late yesterday.

21
00:01:42,314 --> 00:01:44,314
Yes.

22
00:01:44,314 --> 00:01:47,314
Today the exercises start.

23
00:01:47,314 --> 00:01:49,314
Oh, you don't want to anymore.

24
00:01:49,314 --> 00:01:53,314
Yes, but I have to think about Grandmother. It's a pity that she's gone.

25
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:56,314
She's not far away. She'll come to visit us again.

26
00:01:56,314 --> 00:01:58,314
Clara.

27
00:02:00,314 --> 00:02:04,314
I know all that. She doesn't want to go home before I can walk.

28
00:02:04,922 --> 00:02:10,922
Well, there you have it. Then start practicing today. You promised it to her
yesterday.

29
00:02:11,922 --> 00:02:16,922
A promise is a promise. How will you ever be able to run if you don't start
practicing?

30
00:02:16,922 --> 00:02:20,922
Good. Let's start. I promised it.

31
00:02:20,922 --> 00:02:25,922
You don't have to be afraid. You've proven that you can run. You just have to
believe in it.

32
00:02:25,922 --> 00:02:28,922
Yes. Good.

33
00:02:30,778 --> 00:02:33,778
That's not how it works. You have to turn to me.

34
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:36,778
I want that all the time.

35
00:02:36,778 --> 00:02:39,778
Wait, I'll help you.

36
00:02:39,778 --> 00:02:42,778
Heidi, what are you doing? You're hurting me.

37
00:02:42,778 --> 00:02:44,778
And now you just have to get up.

38
00:02:44,778 --> 00:02:47,778
When the cow ran up to you, you could do that too.

39
00:02:50,778 --> 00:02:53,778
Your feet are already on the ground. Did you notice?

40
00:02:53,778 --> 00:02:55,778
It doesn't hurt at all.

41
00:02:55,778 --> 00:02:59,130
Well, you see, now you just have to get up.

42
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,130
I don't know if it's possible.

43
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,130
Hold on to me.

44
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,130
I don't trust you.

45
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:03,130
I don't know.

46
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,130
Slowly.

47
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,130
Clara.

48
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,130
Does it hurt?

49
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,130
Please say something.

50
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,130
Grandfather, quick!

51
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,130
Come on, help!

52
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,130
Is it bad?

53
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,130
No, it's not.

54
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,130
Clara.

55
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,916
How did you get on the floor?

56
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,916
She tried to stand up.

57
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:31,916
Hm?

58
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:32,916
Yes.

59
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:34,916
And did you make it?

60
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:38,916
No, my legs didn't move at all. And I was scared.

61
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:41,916
Why? You don't have to be scared.

62
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:42,916
I know.

63
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:46,916
That she fell is my fault. I couldn't hold her because she is so heavy.

64
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:48,916
Did you convince her to this attempt?

65
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:52,916
Or did you feel the desire to try, Clara?

66
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:53,802
No.

67
00:03:53,802 --> 00:03:56,202
It was me, but Clara wanted it, too.

68
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:59,402
Next time, it won't be without me. Understood?

69
00:04:00,802 --> 00:04:02,002
It's still too early.

70
00:04:02,202 --> 00:04:04,802
Clara's legs are not used to running yet.

71
00:04:05,202 --> 00:04:07,002
Now don't let yourself be discouraged.

72
00:04:07,202 --> 00:04:09,402
We're starting slowly, step by step.

73
00:04:09,602 --> 00:04:11,802
This won't work overnight.

75
00:04:31,156 --> 00:04:33,156
Did it hurt you?

76
00:04:35,156 --> 00:04:37,156
Yes, a little.

77
00:04:37,156 --> 00:04:39,156
Very good. Really excellent.

78
00:04:39,156 --> 00:04:41,156
I was afraid you didn't feel anything at all.

79
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,156
I would have preferred that.

80
00:04:43,156 --> 00:04:45,156
I can imagine that.

81
00:04:45,156 --> 00:04:48,156
But the pain proves to me that your muscles react.

82
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:51,156
Can I do that, yes?

83
00:04:51,156 --> 00:04:52,156
Do you want to?

84
00:04:52,156 --> 00:04:53,156
Yes.

85
00:04:55,156 --> 00:04:56,810
One, two, three.

86
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,970
One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two.

87
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,410
Very slowly, Heidi.

88
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:01,850
The way I did it.

89
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,210
One after the other.

90
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,570
Mhm.

91
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:09,210
One, two, one, two.

92
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,890
Like this?

93
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,250
Yes, that's right.

94
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,690
Slowly and evenly.

95
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:14,490
Is that clear?

96
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,290
And how long is it?

97
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,530
As long as you can.

98
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,730
I'll call you then.

99
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,530
Good.

100
00:05:20,218 --> 00:05:24,218
You know, Heidi, I think it's going to take an infinite amount of time.

101
00:05:24,218 --> 00:05:28,218
We've just started. We're not going to be impatient, are we?

102
00:05:28,218 --> 00:05:33,218
One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two.

103
00:05:33,218 --> 00:05:35,218
That's enough. Let's stop.

104
00:05:35,218 --> 00:05:38,218
Oh no! Grandfather said we should practice as long as we can.

105
00:05:38,218 --> 00:05:45,218
And I can do it for a while. One, two. One, two. One, two.

106
00:05:45,218 --> 00:05:48,218
Good morning! Have you already run?

107
00:05:48,218 --> 00:05:48,756
Good morning!

108
00:05:48,756 --> 00:05:50,196
Good morning, Peter!

109
00:05:50,196 --> 00:05:52,196
Are you coming to the pasture today?

110
00:05:52,196 --> 00:05:55,196
No, we can't. We'll start practicing today.

111
00:05:55,196 --> 00:05:56,796
Ah, then of course we can't.

112
00:05:56,796 --> 00:05:58,196
We'll be late by tonight!

113
00:05:58,196 --> 00:05:59,396
Good morning, everyone!

114
00:05:59,396 --> 00:06:01,196
Watch out for the goats!

115
00:06:01,196 --> 00:06:03,796
Yes, and give the ghost a herb! You know why!

116
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:05,996
I want it to be the best milk in the world!

117
00:06:05,996 --> 00:06:07,396
You don't have to tell me!

118
00:06:07,396 --> 00:06:08,676
Goodbye!

119
00:06:08,676 --> 00:06:10,916
I promise we'll practice hard!

120
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,916
Puppet light! Go!

121
00:06:13,716 --> 00:06:15,716
Let's keep going!

122
00:06:15,716 --> 00:06:17,716
Ice!

123
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:26,044
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10!

124
00:06:26,044 --> 00:06:29,544
And now try to lift your legs up on your own. And now try to lift your legs up
on your own.

125
00:06:29,544 --> 00:06:31,844
Okay, I'll try it. Okay, I'll try it.

126
00:06:47,844 --> 00:06:48,110
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10!

127
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,110
Don't give up.

128
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,110
It will never work.

129
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,110
Yes.

130
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,110
Oh no.

131
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:02,110
One, two, one, two, one, two.

132
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:06,110
Now watch out, I'll try again.

133
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:22,110
You moved it.

134
00:07:22,286 --> 00:07:24,286
All of a sudden I knew what I had to do.

135
00:07:24,286 --> 00:07:26,286
I told myself I could do it.

136
00:07:26,286 --> 00:07:27,286
See?

137
00:07:27,286 --> 00:07:30,286
Do you finally think you can walk, Clara?

138
00:07:30,286 --> 00:07:32,286
Now I have to believe it.

139
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:35,286
We have to practice harder. It has to get better.

140
00:07:35,286 --> 00:07:38,286
One, two. One, two.

141
00:07:45,134 --> 00:07:48,134
Ghost, come on, you should have some too!

142
00:07:57,134 --> 00:08:00,134
What do you say to that?

143
00:08:00,174 --> 00:08:05,174
We're just getting started with the practice and you're already making such
progress?

144
00:08:05,174 --> 00:08:09,174
Clara, I'm happy. Together we can do it.

145
00:08:09,174 --> 00:08:12,174
Yes, now I know it too.

146
00:08:19,174 --> 00:08:21,174
Is Clara already gone?

147
00:08:21,174 --> 00:08:23,174
Good evening, Peter, good evening!

148
00:08:23,174 --> 00:08:26,030
Go, say quickly, have you already got up?

149
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:29,030
No, not yet. That would be too early.

150
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,030
What? Why?

151
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:34,030
Now don't be so disappointed. I can show you something else.

152
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:37,030
Pay attention. Here.

153
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:43,030
Yes, tell me, Clara. You can move.

154
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,940
All of a sudden it went all by itself. Right, Heidi?

155
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,940
Yes, tonight we have to write a letter to the grandmother.

156
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,940
She must know that you can move her.

157
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,940
Yes, and you'll give it to her tomorrow at the post office.

158
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,940
Huh? Oh, Heidi.

159
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,940
Oh.

160
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:02,940
Heidi, a big kiss, please!

161
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,940
Yes, of course, we'll do that.

162
00:09:35,684 --> 00:09:41,684
It's getting better and better!

163
00:09:42,184 --> 00:09:45,184
Slowly, one more piece, come on!

164
00:09:54,184 --> 00:09:56,184
So...

165
00:10:06,184 --> 00:10:08,184
Can you run now?

166
00:10:08,424 --> 00:10:11,424
Now tell me, Clara, quickly, have you already walked today?

167
00:10:11,424 --> 00:10:14,424
No, not yet, but almost. It won't take long.

168
00:10:14,424 --> 00:10:17,424
Today I would have sworn that you can do it.

169
00:10:17,424 --> 00:10:19,424
Well?

170
00:10:19,424 --> 00:10:21,424
Oh, the letters. There, they are for you.

171
00:10:21,424 --> 00:10:24,424
You didn't get them upstairs in the garden, did you?

172
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:27,424
Of course not, I forgot them again this morning.

173
00:10:27,424 --> 00:10:30,424
I thought of the grandmother. There, Clara.

174
00:10:30,424 --> 00:10:31,424
Thank you.

175
00:10:31,424 --> 00:10:34,424
But now I'm curious.

176
00:10:34,424 --> 00:10:37,424
I'm afraid I won't be able to help you.

177
00:10:37,424 --> 00:10:37,736
You're welcome.

178
00:10:37,736 --> 00:10:43,136
Dear Heidi, thank you so much for helping Clara practice every day.

179
00:10:43,136 --> 00:10:47,536
I'm thinking about you and I'm trying to imagine what you're doing.

180
00:10:47,536 --> 00:10:50,936
The sanatorium I'm in is very nice.

181
00:10:50,936 --> 00:10:54,736
When I look out the window, I see the mountains right in front of me.

182
00:10:54,736 --> 00:10:58,136
And then I know that somewhere up there are my two children

183
00:10:58,136 --> 00:11:02,136
and that at some point Clara will learn to walk up there.

184
00:11:02,136 --> 00:11:07,336
I had a dream the other day. I saw how Clara walked across the meadow and was
faster than you, Heidi.

185
00:11:07,486 --> 00:11:10,986
Did you hear what I just read? She dreamed that you could walk!

186
00:11:10,986 --> 00:11:12,986
Leave me alone!

187
00:11:12,986 --> 00:11:15,986
All of you are waiting for me to finally be able to walk!

188
00:11:15,986 --> 00:11:17,986
And what if I can't?

189
00:11:17,986 --> 00:11:19,986
But Clara...

190
00:11:19,986 --> 00:11:23,986
I want to tell you something. It doesn't matter to me if I ever walk.

191
00:11:23,986 --> 00:11:25,486
But...

192
00:11:25,486 --> 00:11:27,486
Stop crying.

193
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:29,486
Clara, you will be able to walk.

194
00:11:31,486 --> 00:11:33,486
I don't want to walk anymore.

195
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,986
I don't care anymore.

196
00:11:37,986 --> 00:11:40,486
I don't want to practice anymore.

197
00:11:42,486 --> 00:11:45,486
I just want you to finally leave me alone.

198
00:11:47,986 --> 00:11:51,486
And I don't want Peter to ask me every night.

199
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:10,890
Clara, it's okay. Maybe they're all too impatient. You're right.

200
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:16,890
We will give you more time. Peter doesn't ask anymore and Heidi doesn't push
anymore.

201
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:20,890
We wish it for you. Nobody wanted to hurt you.

202
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,890
I'm sorry. Me too.

203
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:25,890
If I did something wrong, I'm sorry. Me too.

204
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,890
I'm sorry, please.

205
00:12:29,442 --> 00:12:34,442
I'm sorry, Grandfather. I can't go on like this.

206
00:12:34,442 --> 00:12:38,442
I give up. I want to go back to Frankfurt.

207
00:12:38,442 --> 00:12:40,442
Good.

208
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:03,370
Before we started our sound exercises, you couldn't even move your legs.

209
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,370
And now you can.

210
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,370
Is that right or am I saying something wrong?

211
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,370
Now say something, Clara.

212
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,370
It's right.

213
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,370
You see.

214
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:20,370
In the beginning you thought it was going very fast.

215
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,370
You just have to practice a little bit, nothing more.

216
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:26,370
And now all of a sudden you see that it's not going the way you think.

217
00:13:26,792 --> 00:13:32,792
That makes you impatient and makes you doubt, because you didn't believe in the
effectiveness of the exercise from the start.

218
00:13:33,792 --> 00:13:37,792
How do you know? I really didn't believe in the exercises.

219
00:13:39,792 --> 00:13:43,792
Every time I wanted something from you, you saw it.

220
00:13:44,792 --> 00:13:48,792
Clara, I know you in the meantime. You lose your temper so easily.

221
00:13:50,792 --> 00:13:55,792
You know, I won't take one from you. I don't think you really want to go back to
Frankfurt so quickly.

222
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,680
I don't think you're that weak and cowardly.

223
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,680
Of course you want to be able to walk, but you can't walk fast enough.

224
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,680
And that's why you're crying.

225
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,680
No, not because of that!

226
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:20,290
Ungrateful people can not run and will never be able to live in it.

227
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:25,290
Fortunately, you don't have to listen to him, because you can run if you want.

228
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:28,290
It shouldn't matter how long it takes.

229
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:33,290
Tell me, isn't the main thing to know that you learn it one day?

230
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:41,290
I'm sorry. I don't know what happened to me.

231
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,290
Somehow the courage was gone.

232
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:47,184
Hm, I knew it would come.

233
00:14:48,184 --> 00:14:51,184
Ah, Clara, what a beautiful sunset.

234
00:14:52,184 --> 00:14:54,184
Yes.

235
00:14:58,588 --> 00:15:01,588
I don't understand anything anymore.

236
00:15:17,756 --> 00:15:22,756
Well, Almö, looking for a house again, or are you just passing by for no reason?

237
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:25,756
Oh, where are you from? I want to ask you something.

238
00:15:25,756 --> 00:15:28,756
Is your butter still as good as it used to be, or has it been left behind?

239
00:15:28,756 --> 00:15:32,756
Left behind? My butter is the best butter in the area, and you know that.

240
00:15:32,756 --> 00:15:34,756
Otherwise you wouldn't have come.

241
00:15:34,756 --> 00:15:38,756
Michael, bring me the butter we just made.

242
00:15:38,756 --> 00:15:42,756
Look at this. What does it look like? Huh?

243
00:15:42,756 --> 00:15:47,074
Hmm. Yes, quite decent. Tell me.

244
00:15:47,074 --> 00:15:50,074
Why don't you repair your pot? The water's running out.

245
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:53,074
I know. I just didn't get the hang of it.

246
00:15:53,074 --> 00:15:58,074
I'll make you an offer. I'll repair the pot, and you'll give me the butter.

247
00:15:58,074 --> 00:16:01,074
Yes, I have nothing against it.

248
00:16:01,074 --> 00:16:03,074
Strange.

249
00:16:10,364 --> 00:16:12,364
Why doesn't he take his own butter?

250
00:16:12,364 --> 00:16:15,364
I think he needs ours for the maimed girl from Frankfurt,

251
00:16:15,364 --> 00:16:17,364
who is in his hut upstairs.

252
00:16:17,364 --> 00:16:20,364
And he wants to pay for the butter somewhere.

253
00:16:20,364 --> 00:16:23,364
Hard to believe how he has changed.

255
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,620
So you're still standing here.

256
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:00,620
Now I haven't been up here for years and everything is still as it was.

257
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,404
Heidi! Clara!

258
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:13,404
I picked them for you, because you must be busy again today.

259
00:17:13,404 --> 00:17:15,404
Thank you, Peter, that's nice of you.

260
00:17:15,404 --> 00:17:17,404
Nice, thank you.

261
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:19,404
I don't care and I don't ask.

262
00:17:19,404 --> 00:17:21,404
Yes, today you can ask.

263
00:17:21,404 --> 00:17:23,404
He can, right?

264
00:17:23,404 --> 00:17:25,404
Yes, it's getting better and better.

265
00:17:25,404 --> 00:17:27,404
That makes me happy. Keep practicing, okay?

266
00:17:27,404 --> 00:17:29,404
Oh dear.

267
00:17:31,404 --> 00:17:33,404
What happened to her?

268
00:17:33,404 --> 00:17:35,404
Come on, let's see what's going on.

269
00:17:35,404 --> 00:17:37,404
Oh dear.

270
00:17:37,404 --> 00:17:38,674
Oh dear.

271
00:17:38,674 --> 00:17:41,674
So don't stand around, make sure I get rid of the goats.

272
00:17:41,674 --> 00:17:44,674
I can't do anything about it, they ran away on their own.

273
00:17:44,674 --> 00:17:46,674
Watch out that I get rid of them.

274
00:17:46,674 --> 00:17:49,674
Get lost, make sure you get away, go!

275
00:17:49,674 --> 00:17:52,674
What about the goats, they've never done that before.

276
00:17:52,674 --> 00:17:57,674
Nothing special, I've collected their favorite herbs and they smell good.

277
00:17:57,674 --> 00:17:59,674
And do you want to give them to Swain?

278
00:17:59,674 --> 00:18:02,674
Of course, their milk has to be just as good as Geislein's.

279
00:18:02,674 --> 00:18:04,636
Now go.

280
00:18:04,636 --> 00:18:05,636
All for me.

281
00:18:05,636 --> 00:18:07,636
I can't just take them away.

282
00:18:07,636 --> 00:18:09,636
What am I supposed to do?

283
00:18:10,636 --> 00:18:12,636
They don't listen to me anymore.

284
00:18:12,636 --> 00:18:16,636
If I don't want to stay in here all night, I'll have to come up with something.

285
00:18:16,636 --> 00:18:18,636
Joseph!

286
00:18:18,636 --> 00:18:20,636
Come here!

287
00:18:21,506 --> 00:18:23,506
Come back!

288
00:18:23,506 --> 00:18:25,506
Come back!

289
00:18:29,506 --> 00:18:31,506
Come back!

290
00:18:31,506 --> 00:18:33,506
Come back!

291
00:18:35,506 --> 00:18:37,506
Good job, Joseph!

292
00:18:37,506 --> 00:18:39,506
Stop it! Not again!

293
00:18:39,506 --> 00:18:41,506
Not again!

294
00:18:41,506 --> 00:18:43,506
Not again!

295
00:18:43,506 --> 00:18:45,506
Goodbye, you two!

296
00:18:45,506 --> 00:18:47,506
Goodbye!

297
00:18:47,506 --> 00:18:49,506
Goodbye!

298
00:18:49,506 --> 00:18:51,506
To be continued

299
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:01,230
The goats are fed, now we have to take care of our food.

300
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,230
They're hungry.

301
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:08,230
You did all this for me. You looked for the herbs for me.

302
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,230
Who eats the herbs, you or Swenli?

303
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,230
Grandfather, you mean...

304
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,230
You mean...

305
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,230
You mean...

306
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:34,422
You mean...

307
00:19:34,422 --> 00:19:37,422
I've already written a lot more than you. Come on, show me!

308
00:19:37,422 --> 00:19:39,422
Oh, stop it! That's mean! Give it to me!

309
00:19:39,422 --> 00:19:44,422
No, Heidi, give me the letter! It doesn't matter what I've written! Give it to
me!

310
00:19:44,422 --> 00:19:49,422
Heidi, give it to me! If you don't stop, I'll read your letter! Give it to me!

311
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:50,422
Heidi!

312
00:19:50,614 --> 00:19:51,614
Please don't.

313
00:19:51,614 --> 00:19:54,614
If you read my letter, I can read what you wrote.

314
00:19:54,614 --> 00:19:55,614
Good.

315
00:19:55,614 --> 00:19:56,614
There you have it.

316
00:19:56,614 --> 00:19:57,614
Here.

317
00:20:20,614 --> 00:20:21,614
Bye.

318
00:20:21,614 --> 00:20:22,614
Bye.

319
00:20:22,614 --> 00:20:23,614
Bye.

320
00:20:23,614 --> 00:20:24,614
Bye.

321
00:20:24,614 --> 00:20:25,430
Bye.

322
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:28,430
Let go of my hands, then I'll fall over.

323
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:30,830
Now!

324
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:35,430
That's not how it works. You just have to forget that you have arms

325
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:38,230
and just think that your legs are supposed to carry you.

326
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:41,430
You're good, I've been trying all this time.

327
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:45,830
Good, go on!

328
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,310
Clara, and?

329
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,310
Did it hurt?

330
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:53,310
Not the legs, but the hand. I fell on it.

331
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,310
Doesn't even sound like it.

332
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:58,310
Probably just a little stung. Come on, let's keep going.

333
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,310
Don't be a frog.

334
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:03,310
Oh, stop it. That has nothing to do with it. I don't feel like it anymore today.

335
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:07,310
When will you all finally realize that it doesn't make sense?

336
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,310
I'll never be able to walk. Never.

337
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,310
Stop complaining!

338
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:15,310
I can't hear it anymore.

339
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:19,750
All the time you say you can't do it. You don't want to do it at all.

340
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,750
And all the time you shout that your legs don't want to carry you.

341
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:28,750
Your legs are fine, do you hear? You just don't want your legs to carry you.

342
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:32,750
Because you don't want to be able to walk at all, Clara.

343
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,750
No, Heidi, don't wake me up. Stay here.

344
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:39,750
No, I don't even think about it. Heidi!

345
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:45,750
This can't be happening.

346
00:21:49,648 --> 00:21:54,448
A little more wobbly, but I'm standing on my own two legs.

347
00:21:54,448 --> 00:21:56,248
She can do it all at once.

348
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:59,048
It can't be, I don't believe it.

349
00:22:04,848 --> 00:22:06,848
Hold on!

350
00:22:08,648 --> 00:22:10,648
Heidi!

351
00:22:11,848 --> 00:22:13,848
I'll hold you, be careful, Clara.

352
00:22:13,848 --> 00:22:15,376
We did it.

353
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:18,616
Yes, it looks like it, but maybe I'm just dreaming.

354
00:22:18,616 --> 00:22:20,616
No! You're not dreaming!

355
00:22:28,876 --> 00:22:32,876
We did it! We did it! We did it!

356
00:22:43,632 --> 00:22:48,632
When Peter came up to the Alps the next morning, he didn't dare to look at it at
first.

357
00:22:48,632 --> 00:22:53,632
But then, when he finally understood what had happened, he was overjoyed.

358
00:22:53,632 --> 00:22:56,632
Heidi and Clara practiced running every day from now on.

359
00:22:56,632 --> 00:23:01,632
And every day went a little better, Clara was able to go a little further.

360
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:05,632
First still supported by Heidi and later even a few steps alone.

361
00:23:05,632 --> 00:23:11,632
But Clara still didn't want to believe that she could finally run.

362
00:23:12,038 --> 00:23:17,038
And when the bad luck with the wheelchair happened, it was unbearable.

363
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:21,038
But we want to tell you about it in our next story.

364
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:29,468
Heidi, Heidi, your world are the mountains.

365
00:23:29,468 --> 00:23:37,468
Heidi, Heidi, because up here you are at home.

366
00:23:37,468 --> 00:23:43,468
Heidi, Heidi, come home.

367
00:23:43,468 --> 00:23:50,468
Find your happiness, come back home.

368
00:23:51,468 --> 00:23:53,040
