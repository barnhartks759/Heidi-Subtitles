1
00:01:19,514 --> 00:01:30,514
Heidi had been living in the alp for three months now in the mountain hut and in
these three months she had become the adventurous Heidi out of the pale little
girl she once was

2
00:01:34,514 --> 00:01:38,514
She had now got used to life here on the alp

3
00:01:38,514 --> 00:01:45,514
She could even, and she was very proud of it, milk the fingers of pipes and
goats

4
00:02:06,106 --> 00:02:09,106
You have made great progress, you can even land

5
00:02:12,106 --> 00:02:14,106
Now all we need is milk

6
00:02:14,106 --> 00:02:15,106
Milk?

7
00:02:15,106 --> 00:02:18,106
Stop eating, I want to milk you

8
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:25,106
Look at the face Peter is making, he still doesn't believe I can do it

9
00:02:26,106 --> 00:02:29,106
I never thought you would learn so fast

10
00:02:33,594 --> 00:02:37,594
Do you come to help me? Or do you want some milk too, Pete?

11
00:02:37,594 --> 00:02:39,594
Do you want something to eat?

12
00:02:55,329 --> 00:03:00,329
I'll be blown away and you just sit still. Don't do anything there and eat
cheese.

13
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:04,329
I didn't eat the cheese. I held it down so it wouldn't be blown away either.

14
00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:08,329
Then at least look at the big clouds back there. We're getting rain.

15
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:13,329
Oh, they're much too fast. The clouds are raining somewhere else.

16
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:15,329
And the wind? What about it?

17
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:19,329
It's not dangerous either. It always gets so strong in autumn.

18
00:03:24,353 --> 00:03:27,353
So you have to get used to it. Summer is over.

19
00:03:27,353 --> 00:03:30,353
If you think I have to get used to it...

20
00:03:30,353 --> 00:03:32,353
Then I have to try to get used to it.

21
00:03:32,353 --> 00:03:34,353
Wind?

22
00:04:46,177 --> 00:04:48,677
But the view is very beautiful.

23
00:04:50,677 --> 00:04:52,177
Let's eat something.

24
00:04:59,361 --> 00:05:02,361
But it took a long time for him to get down there.

25
00:05:11,553 --> 00:05:13,553
Why do you always run? Go slow.

26
00:05:13,553 --> 00:05:15,553
That's not possible!

27
00:05:15,553 --> 00:05:17,553
The day is way too short.

28
00:05:17,553 --> 00:05:19,553
If I go slow, I'll only experience half of it.

29
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:21,553
I see.

30
00:05:21,553 --> 00:05:23,553
But of course. You know what?

31
00:05:23,553 --> 00:05:25,553
You know what, Grandfather? I almost got blown away today.

32
00:05:27,553 --> 00:05:29,553
We sat quietly on the meadow and wanted to eat.

33
00:05:29,553 --> 00:05:31,553
A very strong wind came.

34
00:05:31,553 --> 00:05:33,553
And it threw me over.

35
00:05:33,553 --> 00:05:35,553
Hopefully not in the vicinity of the cliff.

36
00:05:44,193 --> 00:05:46,193
Why don't you let me milk the goat?

37
00:05:46,193 --> 00:05:48,193
Do you think you can do that?

38
00:05:48,193 --> 00:05:50,193
Of course. You'll see.

39
00:05:58,472 --> 00:06:00,472
It's better than I thought.

40
00:06:00,472 --> 00:06:03,472
Peter didn't think I could do it either.

41
00:06:06,472 --> 00:06:09,472
Heidi, please don't go with Peter to the pasture from tomorrow.

42
00:06:09,472 --> 00:06:10,472
Why?

43
00:06:10,472 --> 00:06:15,472
Look, the autumn storms are getting stronger and more dangerous day by day.

44
00:06:15,472 --> 00:06:18,472
Today you thought it was all a funny game.

45
00:06:18,472 --> 00:06:21,472
But tomorrow it can be bitterly serious.

46
00:06:22,222 --> 00:06:25,022
You are small and the autumn storms are very strong.

47
00:06:25,022 --> 00:06:27,822
But then I can hold on somewhere.

48
00:06:27,822 --> 00:06:30,722
Nothing will happen to me for sure. Please let me go.

49
00:06:30,722 --> 00:06:33,022
I flew like an eagle today.

50
00:06:33,022 --> 00:06:36,022
I leaned against the wind and it drove me.

51
00:06:36,022 --> 00:06:41,422
And then I got faster and faster and then a cloud came and I hid in it.

52
00:06:41,422 --> 00:06:43,522
You could have crashed.

53
00:06:43,522 --> 00:06:49,022
I was so fast that I would have jumped over it, but Peter stopped me.

54
00:06:49,406 --> 00:06:52,606
So fast, that's enough. I'm already done.

55
00:06:52,606 --> 00:06:56,606
Heidi, it's too dangerous. You'll stay here from tomorrow.

56
00:06:56,606 --> 00:06:58,606
But that, but no, but...

57
00:07:13,096 --> 00:07:15,596
Good morning, Piepmatz! Where were you yesterday afternoon?

58
00:07:16,096 --> 00:07:17,596
Good morning!

59
00:07:19,596 --> 00:07:20,596
Good morning!

60
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Father, have you noticed that I can go with you today?

61
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
There are no big clouds in the sky and it doesn't hurt!

62
00:07:49,704 --> 00:07:54,704
Heidi, I haven't changed my mind. It's not raining yet because it's still early.

63
00:07:59,496 --> 00:08:01,496
I'm sure it's not raining.

64
00:08:16,904 --> 00:08:18,904
Are you ready? Can we go?

65
00:08:18,904 --> 00:08:20,904
I'm not allowed to go with you.

66
00:08:20,904 --> 00:08:21,904
I'm sorry, Snuggie.

67
00:08:21,904 --> 00:08:23,904
Grandfather forbade it yesterday.

68
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:24,904
Unfortunately.

69
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,904
Why is that?

70
00:08:26,904 --> 00:08:30,904
He says the storms in autumn are too dangerous for me.

71
00:08:31,904 --> 00:08:33,904
Goodbye, Snuggie.

72
00:08:33,904 --> 00:08:34,904
Take care.

73
00:08:34,904 --> 00:08:36,904
Go, go to your father.

74
00:08:36,904 --> 00:08:37,904
She doesn't want to.

75
00:08:37,904 --> 00:08:39,904
That's how it is, good boy.

76
00:08:39,904 --> 00:08:40,904
Run fast.

77
00:08:42,904 --> 00:08:45,904
I know, I don't want to.

78
00:08:46,904 --> 00:08:46,996
I don't want to.

79
00:08:50,255 --> 00:08:55,255
Grandfather, please let me go with Tina. They all don't want to go without me.

80
00:08:55,255 --> 00:08:59,255
They're used to me. I've always been there.

81
00:09:00,255 --> 00:09:03,255
I'm definitely not going today.

82
00:09:03,255 --> 00:09:06,255
Once and for all, you stay here.

83
00:09:09,255 --> 00:09:13,255
Come with me, Heidi. We'll light a fire and then we'll make cheese together.

84
00:09:13,255 --> 00:09:15,255
We'll make the cheese ourselves?

85
00:09:16,085 --> 00:09:18,885
That'll be fun. I've never seen that before.

86
00:09:18,885 --> 00:09:22,885
I'm sorry, Peter, but you have to see that I can't come with you today.

87
00:09:23,885 --> 00:09:26,885
Goodbye. We'll see each other on the way back.

88
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:06,735
I can get angry, but Peter is still much louder.

89
00:10:06,735 --> 00:10:09,735
He's a hothead, he always was.

90
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:11,735
And what a guy!

91
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:40,679
And all of this because Heidi isn't coming with us today.

92
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:46,679
As a little boy, weren't you allowed to go to the pasture too?

93
00:10:52,111 --> 00:10:55,111
All of a sudden, it started to rain.

94
00:10:57,111 --> 00:11:00,111
The wind is so strong that it knocked on the door.

95
00:11:00,111 --> 00:11:03,111
You were right, all of a sudden it was stormy.

96
00:11:03,111 --> 00:11:05,111
Do you understand what I mean now?

97
00:11:05,111 --> 00:11:10,111
Yes, but I would still like to go to the alps.

98
00:11:13,111 --> 00:11:15,111
Listen to how that roars.

99
00:11:15,111 --> 00:11:17,111
Those are our roosters.

100
00:11:17,111 --> 00:11:20,111
Soon Peter won't be able to get up either.

101
00:11:20,565 --> 00:11:23,565
Do you think it's dangerous for him and the goats today?

102
00:11:23,565 --> 00:11:25,565
I'll go check it out.

103
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:35,023
Heidi often stood under the tall fir trees and listened to the rustle of the
branches.

104
00:11:35,023 --> 00:11:40,023
She kept believing she could understand words and thought the fir wanted to talk
to her.

105
00:11:40,023 --> 00:11:46,023
Until now, Heidi had always heard friendly words, but today the fir spoke to her
in a completely different way.

106
00:11:52,438 --> 00:11:55,438
Heidi, come in. The wind is too cold.

107
00:11:56,438 --> 00:11:58,438
Grandfather wants us to come in.

108
00:11:59,438 --> 00:12:03,438
Tell me, are you talking to yourself or are you talking to the trees?

109
00:12:04,438 --> 00:12:07,438
Neither of them. Peep must be hidden somewhere in the tree.

110
00:12:08,438 --> 00:12:14,438
You and your bird. He won't come for sure. He will have hidden somewhere in
front of the wind.

111
00:12:15,438 --> 00:12:16,438
He always comes when I call him.

112
00:12:17,438 --> 00:12:18,236
Not today, Heidi.

113
00:12:18,236 --> 00:12:20,936
The wind is too strong and too dangerous for him.

114
00:12:20,936 --> 00:12:23,736
He can't handle his little birds.

115
00:12:23,736 --> 00:12:24,736
You think so?

116
00:12:24,736 --> 00:12:26,736
Then it doesn't make sense for me to wait.

117
00:12:30,236 --> 00:12:32,736
Don't you have to warm them up and stir them?

118
00:12:32,736 --> 00:12:34,736
Oh, don't worry, my child.

119
00:12:34,736 --> 00:12:35,736
I'm already here.

120
00:12:35,736 --> 00:12:37,736
Didn't you bring me a mixing spoon?

121
00:12:37,736 --> 00:12:38,736
No.

122
00:12:38,736 --> 00:12:40,736
Why would you need a spoon?

123
00:12:41,736 --> 00:12:44,736
But didn't you say we'd do it together?

124
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:57,550
Just looking at it is boring.

125
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,550
See, now I can help you.

126
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,550
I stand on the shimmy very well.

127
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,550
Only the spoon is missing.

128
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,550
Why don't you give me a spoon?

129
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,550
How should I know which one I can't take?

130
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,550
You won't do it right.

131
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:14,550
Why? Every little child can stir in the milk.

132
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,550
I'll prove it to you. Give me your stick, please.

133
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,550
The milk will get very hot.

134
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,550
I know. I'm careful.

135
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,550
Yes, I can see that.

136
00:13:24,828 --> 00:13:29,948
Ouch! What is it? Did you burn yourself? No, no, it just splashed.

137
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,230
So I can do it.

138
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,230
Stir evenly.

139
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,230
I know.

140
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:54,230
If you promise me to keep stirring and not stop, I can take care of the hay in
the meantime.

141
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:59,230
A lot has to be done today and you don't seem to need my help at all.

142
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,230
I really don't need you.

143
00:15:03,229 --> 00:15:06,229
Are you the grandfather?

144
00:15:09,229 --> 00:15:11,229
Probably not.

145
00:15:18,077 --> 00:15:20,077
Who's there?

146
00:15:22,077 --> 00:15:24,077
Then don't.

147
00:15:33,245 --> 00:15:35,245
Somehow strange.

148
00:16:01,053 --> 00:16:03,053
Where did you come from?

149
00:16:05,053 --> 00:16:07,053
Don't yell at me right now.

150
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:09,053
I'm glad you're here.

151
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,001
But where are the others?

152
00:16:32,253 --> 00:16:35,253
Tell me, Schnucki, did you run away from the herd?

153
00:16:37,253 --> 00:16:41,253
You can't have run all the way from the alp to here by yourself

154
00:16:41,253 --> 00:16:44,253
if you had broken a leg!

155
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:48,253
Oh, Schnucki, Schnucki, what a lovely little animal you are!

156
00:17:13,693 --> 00:17:15,693
That's what I thought!

157
00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:23,309
Wait!

158
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:23,817
No!

159
00:17:36,772 --> 00:17:37,772
No!

160
00:17:37,772 --> 00:17:41,772
Possible, but the albino here said not to do it when she runs away.

161
00:18:36,164 --> 00:18:42,164
I'm sorry. I didn't want that, Grandfather, I really didn't.

162
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:45,664
- What now? - There's nothing we can do.

163
00:18:45,664 --> 00:18:48,164
We'll start from the beginning tomorrow.

164
00:18:53,636 --> 00:18:58,596
I shouldn't have let it happen. It was way too hard for a little girl.

165
00:19:02,436 --> 00:19:06,436
It's not that bad, either. Don't be so sad.

166
00:19:07,436 --> 00:19:10,436
We'll milk the goats tomorrow and start over.

167
00:19:13,436 --> 00:19:15,436
Heidi?

168
00:19:37,956 --> 00:19:42,316
On this day, Heidi was very, very unhappy for the first time.

169
00:19:42,316 --> 00:19:46,996
She had burned the milk and Peter had beaten her favorite goat, Schnucki,

170
00:19:46,996 --> 00:19:49,996
although she had thrown herself in between to help.

171
00:19:49,996 --> 00:19:52,996
Heidi felt helpless and useless.

172
00:19:52,996 --> 00:19:57,996
She stood long under her tarp and hoped to hear a single comforting word.

173
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:02,698
But the branches rustled, dodged the wind and did not speak to her.

174
00:20:02,698 --> 00:20:09,698
If only Heidi had known how she could tell her grandfather that it was not she,
but Schnucki, who was to blame for the burnt milk.

175
00:20:09,698 --> 00:20:12,698
Without him being just as angry with Schnucki as Peter was.

176
00:20:16,698 --> 00:20:18,698
I know what I'm doing now!

177
00:20:20,698 --> 00:20:25,698
I didn't let the milk burn because I was too small, but because I paid attention
to a goat.

178
00:20:25,698 --> 00:20:27,698
Unfortunately, I don't remember the name anymore.

179
00:20:27,698 --> 00:20:29,658
So that's how it is.

180
00:20:29,658 --> 00:20:32,658
She was in danger and I thought goats are more important than cheese.

181
00:20:32,658 --> 00:20:34,658
You're not quite wrong.

182
00:20:34,658 --> 00:20:38,658
At least you can have goats without cheese, but no cheese without goats.

183
00:20:39,658 --> 00:20:41,658
The bill is almost up.

184
00:20:58,251 --> 00:21:00,251
Was it nice on the pasture today?

185
00:21:00,251 --> 00:21:03,251
No! You're not supposed to bite into my skirt!

186
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:18,843
I don't understand anything anymore.

187
00:21:18,843 --> 00:21:19,927
Goodbye!

188
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:45,411
When Heidi got up the next morning, the fire was already burning in the living
room and over the fire there was already a bowl of fresh milk. Heidi was allowed
to help as much as she wanted, but this time the grandfather stayed close to her
to make sure that she would not let the milk burn again, to help a certain goat
whose name she could not say.

189
00:21:45,411 --> 00:21:49,411
Tell me, are we going to make cheese again today, grandfather?

190
00:21:49,681 --> 00:21:56,681
Many days in a row, the two of them processed the fresh milk of their goats into
large round cheese wheels.

191
00:21:56,681 --> 00:22:01,681
And Heidi took her role as "cheese helper", as she called herself, very
seriously.

192
00:22:01,681 --> 00:22:08,681
She cleaned and wiped and stirred, and again and again she reported to her tree
how many cheeses she had already produced.

193
00:22:08,681 --> 00:22:13,681
She even forgot, out of enthusiasm, Peter, the goats and the pasture.

194
00:22:19,979 --> 00:22:25,979
The days were getting shorter and shorter, the leaves were discolored, it was
autumn.

195
00:22:25,979 --> 00:22:28,979
For Heidi it was time to say goodbye to a dear friend.

196
00:22:28,979 --> 00:22:32,979
Piep joined a flock of birds to fly to the south.

197
00:22:32,979 --> 00:22:35,979
And Heidi was distressed.

198
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:38,979
Peter tried to distract her with a new bird.

199
00:22:38,979 --> 00:22:42,979
But Heidi wouldn't be Heidi if she had calmed down so quickly.

200
00:22:42,979 --> 00:22:48,849
Again and again she wanted to know when and how she could see her Piep again.

201
00:22:48,849 --> 00:22:54,349
But the hope that the next spring would bring back the singing birds was only a
weak consolation for her.

202
00:22:55,349 --> 00:22:58,849
But we want to tell you about that in our next story.
