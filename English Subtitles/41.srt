00:00:20,302 --> 00:00:24,302
Heidi, Heidi

3
00:00:24,302 --> 00:00:28,302
Your world are the mountains

4
00:00:28,302 --> 00:00:32,302
Heidi, Heidi

5
00:00:32,302 --> 00:00:36,302
Because up here you are at home

6
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:40,302
Dark berries

7
00:00:40,302 --> 00:00:44,302
Green meadows in the sunshine

8
00:00:44,302 --> 00:00:48,302
Heidi, Heidi

9
00:00:48,302 --> 00:00:52,302
You need to be happy

10

Edi,

00:01:06,302 --> 00:01:10,302
Heidi, Heidi

13
00:01:10,302 --> 00:01:13,302
Come home

14
00:01:13,302 --> 00:01:15,302
Find your happiness

15
00:01:15,302 --> 00:01:20,302
Come back again

16
00:01:25,302 --> 00:01:26,302
Good morning, Grandfather.

17
00:01:26,302 --> 00:01:28,250
Good morning.

18
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,250
Good morning.

19
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,250
But you wake up early.

20
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,250
Don't you know?

21
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,250
Clara is coming from Frankfurt today.

22
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,250
Clara?

23
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,250
Show me the letter, please.

24
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,250
Sure.

25
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,250
Here.

26
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,250
Read it.

27
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:48,410
The Secret Service is leaving in a few days to visit you.

28
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,410
You're wrong, Heidi. She only writes about the Secret Service.

29
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,410
But there's something in it. Thank you.

30
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:56,410
Dear Heidi, no, further down.

31
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:59,410
I'm really looking forward to seeing you again one day.

32
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,410
I knew she wrote it.

33
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,410
That doesn't say anything.

34
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:05,410
Yes, how is she supposed to see me again if she doesn't come?

35
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:08,410
And if Clara writes something like that, she'll come too.

36
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:10,410
What do you want to know?

37
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,410
Maybe I'll film a video of you and Clara getting married.

38
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,386
No, I can't.

39
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:17,386
What else do I have to teach you?

40
00:02:17,386 --> 00:02:19,386
You can't just push Klara around like that.

41
00:02:21,386 --> 00:02:24,386
You have to be careful with Klara, do you hear?

42
00:02:26,386 --> 00:02:28,386
How did you start with that?

43
00:02:28,386 --> 00:02:33,386
What? That's what Snooki always did to my skirt when she was as small as you,
little ghost.

44
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:36,386
Joseph, wake up! I have good news.

45
00:02:36,386 --> 00:02:40,386
We're getting a visitor from Frankfurt, you know, my friend.

46
00:02:41,386 --> 00:02:44,386
Klara is coming! Wake up!

47
00:02:44,858 --> 00:02:46,858
Finally!

48
00:02:54,858 --> 00:02:56,730
Joseph, that's...

49
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,730
That's disgusting!

50
00:03:02,992 --> 00:03:07,992
Josef, did you understand what I said? Clara is coming!

51
00:03:13,392 --> 00:03:16,392
You're not a dog, you're a lazy animal.

52
00:03:16,392 --> 00:03:18,392
Grandfather!

53
00:03:34,392 --> 00:03:37,392
You two probably don't have eyes in your head!

54
00:03:37,392 --> 00:03:39,392
They never do!

55
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:43,488
Of course, those two.

56
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,488
You're not standing there like...

57
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:06,384
good morning peter why don't you say anything you're called peter or something

58
00:04:06,384 --> 00:04:11,064
not where do you know my name because heidi described you to me in frankfurt

59
00:04:11,064 --> 00:04:17,164
exactly described the secret that drives me crazy so i didn't even know that

60
00:04:17,164 --> 00:04:20,704
i look so scary that it drives you crazy when you meet me

61
00:04:20,704 --> 00:04:23,944
i said good morning very kindly or not

62
00:04:23,944 --> 00:04:25,944
yes, already

63
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:32,950
then it's very good, can you take me up to the Alme Oevi you know the way

64
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:36,910
it's still very far

65
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,630
it tastes good

66
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:03,590
I hope you enjoyed the video, thank you for watching and see you in the next
video

67
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,600
And I didn't want to come here first.

68
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
Stop! Not so fast.

69
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,600
Unfortunately, I can't go slower than the goat herd.

70
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,600
Now I know again why I didn't want to come here.

71
00:05:22,672 --> 00:05:24,672
And where is this Clara?

72
00:05:25,672 --> 00:05:27,672
In Frankfurt, where else?

73
00:05:27,672 --> 00:05:30,672
I went ahead, because before we can send Clara here,

74
00:05:30,672 --> 00:05:33,672
I have to take a closer look at the area.

75
00:05:33,672 --> 00:05:35,672
Then she won't come here.

76
00:05:35,672 --> 00:05:38,672
Why are you so angry? Do you really want her to come here?

77
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,672
What? I can do without it.

78
00:05:41,672 --> 00:05:42,672
But not Heidi.

79
00:05:42,672 --> 00:05:45,672
That's what I thought. In Frankfurt she was homesick for you,

80
00:05:45,672 --> 00:05:47,672
and here she is homesick for Clara.

81
00:05:52,672 --> 00:05:56,672
ARD Text im Auftrag von Funk

82
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:08,430
Oh, well, city man.

83
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,430
Let me carry the bag.

84
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,430
No, it's okay. It's way too heavy for you.

85
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,430
I'm used to that. Give it to me.

86
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,430
Yes, if that's the case, that would help a little.

87
00:06:21,606 --> 00:06:24,606
This wonderful air up here.

88
00:06:27,606 --> 00:06:31,606
I can understand Heidi, that she did not feel well in our city.

89
00:06:31,606 --> 00:06:34,606
Only this hill, then we are there.

90
00:06:43,494 --> 00:06:46,494
Finally! Peter's whistling! But it's about time!

91
00:06:49,294 --> 00:06:51,494
Peter! Good morning!

92
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,330
What is he carrying on his shoulders? Is that a suitcase?

93
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:00,330
That can only be Clara's big travel bag.

94
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,330
Peter, where is she?

95
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,330
Where?

96
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,330
Now tell me.

97
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,830
Of course in Frankfurt.

98
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,330
Oh, don't lie. I know the bag.

99
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,330
Mr. Secret Service.

100
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,330
Heidi!

101
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,830
How are you, my child?

102
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,830
Welcome!

103
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,330
How nice that you are here. I'm so happy.

104
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,330
Good day!

105
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,330
Not so stormy.

106
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,330
How do you like the mountains?

107
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,330
Simply overwhelming and beautiful.

108
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,330
But let me greet you first.

109
00:07:23,372 --> 00:07:27,372
Oh, you've grown quite a bit. The mountain air seems to be very good for you.

110
00:07:27,372 --> 00:07:30,372
That pleases me. And burnt brown.

111
00:07:30,372 --> 00:07:33,372
When they are here for a few days, they also look like that.

112
00:07:33,372 --> 00:07:35,372
Yes, maybe. Clara?

113
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:38,372
Good that you remember me. I should greet you warmly.

114
00:07:38,372 --> 00:07:42,372
I don't understand. What should that mean, greet you warmly?

115
00:07:42,372 --> 00:07:45,372
Do you want to stay down in Durfli?

116
00:07:45,372 --> 00:07:49,372
Heidi, Clara didn't come with me. I drove here alone.

117
00:07:49,372 --> 00:07:52,372
She didn't come with you?

118
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:55,372
Yes.

119
00:07:56,038 --> 00:07:58,038
Come on, dear.

120
00:08:02,694 --> 00:08:07,694
I'll explain it to you. You know that Clara can't move without her wheelchair.

121
00:08:07,694 --> 00:08:08,694
Yes.

122
00:08:08,694 --> 00:08:10,694
It's bad, but we can't change it.

123
00:08:10,694 --> 00:08:13,694
You have described in your letters how beautiful it is up here,

124
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:17,694
but you didn't write how she should move in this wheelchair.

125
00:08:17,694 --> 00:08:20,694
I didn't even think about it.

126
00:08:20,694 --> 00:08:25,694
And now they are here to decide whether Clara is allowed to come to us.

127
00:08:26,694 --> 00:08:28,694
I understand that.

128
00:08:28,694 --> 00:08:30,694
Grandfather!

129
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,110
Clara didn't come with us.

130
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:37,110
Yes, Heidi, I know.

131
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,110
I'm happy to finally get to know you.

132
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,110
Heidi told me a lot about you.

133
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,110
She described everything very precisely.

134
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:47,110
Welcome and thank you very much for what you have done for Heidi, Mr. Secret
Service.

135
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,110
I didn't know what to thank you for.

136
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:53,110
For sending Heidi back to me.

137
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:57,110
Mr. Sesemann wrote it in a letter he gave to Heidi.

138
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:58,708
Thank you.

139
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:02,708
Oh no, I had only done what I did best here. The child had a homecoming.

140
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:07,708
Grandfather, the Herr Geheimrat has come to see if Clara can be sent here.

141
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,708
I see, that's why.

142
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:14,708
And earlier you said you like it in the mountains, so Clara can come.

143
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:20,658
What's so strange about that? Did you say it or did you not say it?

144
00:09:20,658 --> 00:09:27,258
Heidi, he has just arrived. He has not seen anything yet, but why don't you show
him your mountains afterwards?

145
00:09:27,258 --> 00:09:31,458
Yes, I will do that and he will like it too. I can tell you that.

146
00:09:32,658 --> 00:09:35,858
In the travel bag are gifts for you from Clara.

147
00:09:36,858 --> 00:09:39,258
She wrote that in the letter, I know.

148
00:09:39,258 --> 00:09:40,858
Then pack it up.

149
00:09:40,858 --> 00:09:43,458
Yes, thank you, we'll do that right away.

150
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,258
Peter, open the bag.

151
00:09:45,258 --> 00:09:47,058
Did she also pack my sausage?

152
00:09:47,058 --> 00:09:49,258
What Clara promises, she keeps it.

153
00:09:50,018 --> 00:10:00,018
What do you think of a big glass of goat's milk?

154
00:10:00,018 --> 00:10:04,018
Fabulous! You can't imagine what kind of thirst I have.

155
00:10:04,018 --> 00:10:08,018
This is the winter coat she wrote.

156
00:10:08,018 --> 00:10:10,018
Why should something like this be good?

157
00:10:10,018 --> 00:10:13,018
This is the warm scarf for your grandmother.

158
00:10:13,018 --> 00:10:16,018
And this is the whistle-trap for my grandfather.

159
00:10:16,162 --> 00:10:18,162
Tell me, what are you looking for?

160
00:10:18,962 --> 00:10:20,962
What? That's what I was looking for.

161
00:10:20,962 --> 00:10:22,962
Such a big sausage.

162
00:10:27,962 --> 00:10:29,962
Peter, there are more!

163
00:10:30,962 --> 00:10:32,962
I think I'm dreaming.

164
00:10:32,962 --> 00:10:33,962
Mine!

165
00:10:33,962 --> 00:10:34,962
No, leave it!

166
00:10:34,962 --> 00:10:35,962
It's mine!

167
00:10:35,962 --> 00:10:37,666
The sausages are for me!

168
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:42,266
Yes, but she wrote that I shouldn't give them to you right away, so that you
don't eat them all at once.

169
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,166
Please, you say it yourself, they're mine!

170
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,766
Give them already! Don't be a frog!

171
00:10:45,766 --> 00:10:49,866
Do you promise me that you'll give them away at home? If not, I'll send them
back to Frankfurt!

172
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:51,966
You don't care about that, do you?

173
00:10:51,966 --> 00:10:52,566
Of course I do!

174
00:10:52,566 --> 00:10:56,466
We'll put all the sausages here in the travel bag and you'll take them home with
you.

175
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:04,666
Goodbye, my sausages.

176
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:05,966
A lot of frogs!

177
00:11:06,722 --> 00:11:09,722
You know why Clara didn't come?

178
00:11:09,722 --> 00:11:10,722
Clara!

179
00:11:10,722 --> 00:11:13,722
Can't you think of anything other than Clara?

180
00:11:13,722 --> 00:11:15,722
I want to tell you something.

181
00:11:15,722 --> 00:11:17,722
You can keep your sausages.

182
00:11:17,722 --> 00:11:19,722
Don't you want to take me with you today?

183
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:21,722
You're going with me? And the secret council?

184
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,722
He just comes with us to the meadow.

185
00:11:23,722 --> 00:11:25,722
We have to show him everything very carefully.

186
00:11:25,722 --> 00:11:27,722
Every mountain and all the meadows.

187
00:11:27,722 --> 00:11:29,722
And of course the flowers.

188
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,722
Say yes, he should see how beautiful it is.

189
00:11:31,722 --> 00:11:35,722
He just has to like it here so that Clara can come.

190
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:38,762
I thought something like that was behind it.

191
00:11:38,762 --> 00:11:42,762
Of course. Don't be like that, Peter. Clara will definitely like it.

192
00:11:42,762 --> 00:11:47,762
Peter, we have to show him all the animals. The marmots and the geese and maybe
an eagle.

193
00:11:47,762 --> 00:11:52,762
I know that Clara will be healthy again. We just have to make it so that she can
come here.

194
00:11:52,762 --> 00:11:55,762
All right. I'll help you.

195
00:11:55,762 --> 00:11:57,762
Peter, what kind of a sweetheart are you?

196
00:11:57,762 --> 00:11:59,762
Ouch!

197
00:12:02,762 --> 00:12:05,762
Just knock the door on my head.

199
00:12:37,778 --> 00:12:39,778
Does it taste good?

200
00:12:40,478 --> 00:12:41,478
A Moor?

201
00:12:41,478 --> 00:12:43,478
A Moor with you!

202
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,478
Peter and I have discovered it!

203
00:13:10,478 --> 00:13:12,478
A Moor with you!

204
00:13:18,978 --> 00:13:20,478
Come in with you, little girl!

205
00:13:21,478 --> 00:13:22,478
Peter!

206
00:13:22,478 --> 00:13:24,978
Goodbye! See you tomorrow!

207
00:13:24,978 --> 00:13:27,478
We'll bring the presents to you later!

208
00:13:27,478 --> 00:13:29,978
Can I say it to your grandmother already?

209
00:13:29,978 --> 00:13:31,478
No, keep it for yourself!

210
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:32,478
I'll do it!

211
00:13:33,478 --> 00:13:34,478
Watch out!

212
00:13:35,978 --> 00:13:37,478
She had her first day in the...

213
00:13:37,554 --> 00:13:42,554
Wonderful. But that it was my first day in the mountains, you can't say that
right now.

214
00:13:42,554 --> 00:13:45,554
I've been spending my vacation in the Alps for 20 years.

215
00:13:45,554 --> 00:13:49,554
That's why I was so worried. I know this landscape.

216
00:13:49,554 --> 00:13:54,554
How should I explain it? It's a paradise, but for Clara it's a dangerous one.

217
00:13:54,554 --> 00:13:55,554
Yes, I know.

218
00:13:55,554 --> 00:13:57,554
What does that mean? What does a dangerous paradise mean?

219
00:13:57,554 --> 00:13:59,554
You're eavesdropping.

220
00:13:59,554 --> 00:14:01,554
That was just on purpose, on purpose.

221
00:14:01,944 --> 00:14:02,944
Calm down.

222
00:14:02,944 --> 00:14:03,944
I don't want to.

223
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:05,944
Do you want to say that Clara is not allowed to come?

224
00:14:05,944 --> 00:14:06,944
I don't know.

225
00:14:06,944 --> 00:14:08,944
You found the day here wonderful.

226
00:14:08,944 --> 00:14:11,944
Why can't it be wonderful for Clara too?

227
00:14:11,944 --> 00:14:14,944
Isn't it about time that you bring Clara's presents downstairs?

228
00:14:14,944 --> 00:14:16,944
If it's too late, you can't go anymore.

229
00:14:16,944 --> 00:14:18,944
Would it do her any good to accompany Heidi

230
00:14:18,944 --> 00:14:21,944
and examine Peter's grandmother at this opportunity?

231
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,944
Of course not.

232
00:14:23,944 --> 00:14:26,944
Well, Heidi, will you take me with you?

233
00:14:27,944 --> 00:14:30,944
I'd love to, but only if you promise me that you'll send Clara.

234
00:14:31,944 --> 00:14:32,944
I promise.

235
00:14:36,754 --> 00:14:40,754
They're supposed to be for us? I don't know how to thank you.

236
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:42,754
They're not mine, they're Clara's.

237
00:14:42,754 --> 00:14:44,754
Can I try the fat one back there?

238
00:14:44,754 --> 00:14:47,754
Finger away! When will you finally learn how to behave?

239
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:49,754
What can I do to get hungry?

240
00:14:49,754 --> 00:14:54,754
At least give him a small one, Brigitte. He's been waiting all day.

241
00:14:54,754 --> 00:14:58,754
Heidi, you're great! I'll try how this one tastes.

242
00:14:59,754 --> 00:15:01,754
Well, does it taste good to you?

243
00:15:01,754 --> 00:15:04,754
Yes, and how does it taste?

244
00:15:05,742 --> 00:15:08,742
Ha, ha, ha, ha, you can tell that it tastes good.

245
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,742
Yes, and thank you again.

246
00:15:10,742 --> 00:15:12,742
How can you guess what this is?

247
00:15:12,742 --> 00:15:15,742
A scarf, a tree scarf for the winter.

248
00:15:15,742 --> 00:15:18,742
Oh, how lovely and soft it feels.

249
00:15:18,742 --> 00:15:20,742
This is pure wool, Heidi.

250
00:15:20,742 --> 00:15:23,742
Thank you, Mr. Secret Agent, thank you very much.

251
00:15:23,742 --> 00:15:26,742
I can use the scarf well, it can be very cold up here.

252
00:15:26,742 --> 00:15:29,742
I've never been in the mountains in winter,

253
00:15:29,742 --> 00:15:32,742
but I've heard that they often have meter-high snow.

254
00:15:32,742 --> 00:15:34,742
Yes, yes, the winters are hard.

255
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:39,602
It's wet and cold, and sometimes you think the sun doesn't want to come at all.

256
00:15:39,602 --> 00:15:42,602
But now I have a warm scarf.

257
00:15:52,424 --> 00:15:57,984
The old woman may be very old, but her health is surprisingly good.

258
00:15:57,984 --> 00:16:00,224
I'm glad you think that, Mr. Heimerath.

259
00:16:00,224 --> 00:16:02,864
If I only knew how to decide.

260
00:16:02,864 --> 00:16:07,424
I am convinced that there is hardly anything better for Clara than the good air.

261
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:13,064
Look at Heidi and then imagine what she looked like when she came back from
Frankfurt.

262
00:16:13,064 --> 00:16:16,264
Yes, I know, she was pale and slim, she was sick.

263
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:19,310
I'm just afraid of the steep slopes.

264
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,310
Tell me, I wanted to ask you that earlier.

265
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:24,310
Do you really believe that Clara will ever be healthy again?

266
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:29,310
Well, at the moment I can't answer your question with a yes or a no.

267
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,310
What?

268
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:34,310
Clara would have to do the prescribed walking exercises regularly.

269
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,310
But she's not strong enough.

270
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:39,310
That's why I'd like to send her.

271
00:16:39,816 --> 00:16:46,816
Star cuddling. If I had a star cuddling, I could wish that Clara would come and
then it would be fulfilled.

273
00:17:11,336 --> 00:17:16,336
Today the view is even better than yesterday

274
00:17:19,752 --> 00:17:23,752
From now on, you have to pick the freshest herbs on the meadow, Swinley.

275
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:25,752
Your milk must be especially good.

276
00:17:25,752 --> 00:17:29,752
We have to prove to the secret council that it is good for Clara to come here.

277
00:17:29,752 --> 00:17:31,752
Good morning, Haydn.

278
00:17:31,752 --> 00:17:33,752
But you got up early.

279
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:35,752
Not early enough, I wanted to be the first.

280
00:17:35,752 --> 00:17:38,752
But you were even earlier than me, as you can see.

281
00:17:38,752 --> 00:17:40,752
Ah, fresh goat's milk.

282
00:17:40,752 --> 00:17:44,752
It's still warm, they don't get fresh milk in Frankfurt.

283
00:17:45,752 --> 00:17:48,752
Ah, it smells good.

284
00:17:49,752 --> 00:17:51,752
Yes.

285
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,208
Drink it all!

286
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:02,208
Delicious! Fresh, healthy milk!

287
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:05,208
That was very nice of you, thank you!

288
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:08,208
That's good, yes! That's even very good!

289
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:12,208
If the milk is as healthy as she said, then she must also be healthy for Clara!

290
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,208
Yes, of course!

291
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:17,208
Clara could drink as much goat milk as she wants, she can do that, right?

292
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,208
Heidi, now listen!

293
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:23,208
Why? Why are you making such a face? What is it?

294
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:23,892
Listen!

295
00:18:23,892 --> 00:18:26,892
We talked about Clara's wheelchair yesterday, didn't we?

296
00:18:26,892 --> 00:18:28,892
Yes, we did.

297
00:18:28,892 --> 00:18:31,892
You have often seen that I have pushed the wheelchair.

298
00:18:31,892 --> 00:18:36,892
Yes, in Frankfurt, on flat earth, on a stone floor or on carpet.

299
00:18:36,892 --> 00:18:37,892
And?

300
00:18:37,892 --> 00:18:39,892
Heidi, that's enough.

301
00:18:39,892 --> 00:18:42,892
You sit with your head through the wall again, that's nonsense.

302
00:18:42,892 --> 00:18:45,892
It's really too dangerous for Clara. I thought about it.

303
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:47,892
Then I just want to go through the wall with my head.

304
00:18:47,892 --> 00:18:50,892
Believe me, I'll treat Clara with all my heart.

305
00:18:51,476 --> 00:18:55,476
Can't you really understand that you can't drive with a wheelchair up here?

306
00:18:56,276 --> 00:18:59,476
Well then, because what do you think would happen

307
00:18:59,476 --> 00:19:03,476
if your Clara can't hold her wheelchair on your steep meadows anymore?

308
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,476
That? Yes.

309
00:19:06,476 --> 00:19:08,476
Did you see it?

310
00:19:08,476 --> 00:19:12,476
Wheelchair, wheelchair, you're always talking about this stupid wheelchair.

311
00:19:12,476 --> 00:19:14,476
None of you think of Clara.

312
00:19:15,092 --> 00:19:16,492
It's about Clara.

313
00:19:16,492 --> 00:19:17,812
Clara wouldn't be alone.

314
00:19:17,812 --> 00:19:19,652
Grandfather, Peter and I are here.

315
00:19:19,652 --> 00:19:21,252
We would all be careful.

316
00:19:21,252 --> 00:19:24,652
If we all help together, we can do it, right?

317
00:19:25,852 --> 00:19:27,772
But the secret ride is against it.

318
00:19:27,772 --> 00:19:29,412
No, no, no, he can't do that.

319
00:19:29,412 --> 00:19:30,772
That can't be.

320
00:19:30,772 --> 00:19:34,212
I want Clara to come visit me and she wants it too.

321
00:19:38,412 --> 00:19:39,932
Our wooden cube.

322
00:19:49,726 --> 00:19:51,726
Broke up.

323
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:58,726
Heidi, come in, we're having breakfast.

324
00:20:04,062 --> 00:20:07,822
What does it matter if she can't sit in the wheelchair?

325
00:20:07,822 --> 00:20:10,822
Clara hates her wheelchair. What does it matter to her?

326
00:20:10,822 --> 00:20:13,302
Can she go wherever she wants with it?

327
00:20:13,302 --> 00:20:17,302
You don't care about what Clara thinks.

328
00:20:17,302 --> 00:20:21,302
You don't care if Clara is sad.

329
00:20:21,302 --> 00:20:24,302
It's definitely possible without this wheelchair.

330
00:20:24,302 --> 00:20:26,302
And even better than with it.

331
00:20:26,302 --> 00:20:28,302
Please, grandfather, please!

332
00:20:28,302 --> 00:20:31,302
Why shouldn't Clara sit in the grass on the meadow?

333
00:20:31,302 --> 00:20:32,564
She would like that.

334
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:36,564
I know that. And she doesn't roll down the slope.

335
00:20:36,564 --> 00:20:40,564
But you don't want to let anything else come to mind.

336
00:20:40,564 --> 00:20:44,564
Clara would be happy here. She told me.

337
00:20:46,564 --> 00:20:48,564
Heidi.

338
00:20:50,564 --> 00:20:52,564
What the child says is right.

339
00:20:52,564 --> 00:20:56,564
We actually only thought about Clara's wheelchair all the time.

340
00:20:56,564 --> 00:21:00,564
I can carry her lightly and she can sit on the ground just as well.

341
00:21:00,564 --> 00:21:02,308
Wait a minute.

342
00:21:02,308 --> 00:21:08,808
Because I ... well, that could have been the problem the whole time.

343
00:21:08,808 --> 00:21:12,608
Clara has relied too much on her wheelchair.

344
00:21:12,608 --> 00:21:14,308
That is possible.

345
00:21:14,308 --> 00:21:18,108
We didn't make it clear to her once that it could go without this thing.

346
00:21:18,108 --> 00:21:21,808
Maybe she'll try to move when she's not sitting in this chair.

347
00:21:21,808 --> 00:21:23,408
Exactly.

348
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:27,308
It's worth a try at least.

349
00:21:27,308 --> 00:21:28,808
Yes.

350
00:21:28,808 --> 00:21:31,608
One should ...

351
00:21:31,636 --> 00:21:33,636
I'll give it a try.

352
00:21:35,636 --> 00:21:37,636
I have to thank you.

353
00:21:37,636 --> 00:21:39,636
So?

354
00:21:39,636 --> 00:21:41,636
We'll do it.

355
00:21:41,636 --> 00:21:43,636
Why not? I don't know what I was against at all.

356
00:21:45,636 --> 00:21:47,636
Is that a promise or not?

357
00:21:47,636 --> 00:21:49,636
It is a promise.

358
00:21:49,636 --> 00:21:51,636
I promise you that she will come.

359
00:21:51,636 --> 00:21:53,636
And you promise me that you will take good care of her

360
00:21:53,636 --> 00:21:55,636
and that you won't let her out of your sight.

361
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:59,910
There you can see what kind of an old donkey I am.

362
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,910
A dear donkey.

363
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:05,910
Clara, come on.

364
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:17,410
That she can be so overbearing, I would never have thought that in Frankfurt.

365
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:19,410
Here she is always like that.

366
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:25,410
I have to tell him that right away.

367
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,180
I have to tell him.

368
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,180
Hurry up, Peter. I have news for you.

369
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,180
For Heidi, the world was back in order.

370
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:38,180
Finally, she would be able to show Clara all that she had always told her.

371
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,180
The mountains, the ponds, the meadows.

372
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:44,180
And, of course, Peter and the goat herd.

373
00:22:53,428 --> 00:23:00,428
Day after day, Heidi waited, after the secret council had left, impatiently for
a sign of life from Clara.

374
00:23:00,428 --> 00:23:04,428
She kept describing to Peter and his grandfather how Clara looked like.

375
00:23:04,428 --> 00:23:08,428
And then one day came the long-awaited letter from Frankfurt.

376
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:10,428
Heidi was out of joy.

377
00:23:10,428 --> 00:23:18,428
And although she knew exactly that the secret council would keep its promise,
she could no longer grasp it at once.

378
00:23:19,428 --> 00:23:22,266
However, one thing Clara had not written.

379
00:23:22,266 --> 00:23:27,666
She had not dared, out of fear that Heidi might be disappointed or would even
give up.

380
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:31,866
But we want to tell you about that in our next story.

381
00:23:31,866 --> 00:23:40,066
Heidi, Heidi, your world are the mountains.

382
00:23:40,066 --> 00:23:48,066
Heidi, Heidi, because up here you are at home.

383
00:23:48,066 --> 00:23:54,066
Heidi, Heidi, come home.

384
00:23:54,066 --> 00:24:01,066
Find your happiness, come back home.
