00:00:20,406 --> 00:00:22,406
Heidi

3
00:00:24,406 --> 00:00:28,406
Your world are the mountains

4
00:00:28,406 --> 00:00:30,406
Heidi

5
00:00:32,406 --> 00:00:36,406
Because up here you are at home

6
00:00:36,406 --> 00:00:38,406
Dark

7
00:00:38,406 --> 00:00:40,406
Trees

8
00:00:40,406 --> 00:00:42,406
Green meadows

9
00:00:42,406 --> 00:00:44,406
In the sunshine

10
00:00:44,406 --> 00:00:46,406
Heidi

11
00:00:46,406 --> 00:00:48,406
Heidi

12
00:00:48,406 --> 00:00:52,406
You need to be happy

13
00:00:52,406 --> 00:00:54,406
Holala Edie

14
00:00:54,406 --> 00:00:56,406
Holala Edie

15
00:00:56,406 --> 00:00:58,406
Holala Edie

16

Holala Edie

00:01:04,406 --> 00:01:06,406
Holala Edie

20
00:01:06,406 --> 00:01:08,406
Heidi

21
00:01:08,406 --> 00:01:10,406
Heidi

22
00:01:10,406 --> 00:01:12,406
Come home

23
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,406
Find your happiness

24
00:01:14,406 --> 00:01:18,406
Come back home

25
00:01:22,234 --> 00:01:30,234
I'm back, grandmother. Good day. Actually, I should be picking flowers, but I
haven't found any.

26
00:01:30,234 --> 00:01:33,234
Picking sausage would be better.

27
00:01:33,234 --> 00:01:39,234
And then I should bring a basket with red wine and a cake, but the baskets down
in the kitchen are all too big.

28
00:01:39,234 --> 00:01:43,234
You have to ask my ears and my eyes.

29
00:01:43,234 --> 00:01:46,080
Good. Why do you have such big ears?

30
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,320
So that I can hear you better.

31
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,840
That's good. Then you can listen to me well.

32
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,320
Because I only look like a red cap.

33
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,240
In reality, I am Robin Hood.

34
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,720
The better. Bring your horse in.

35
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,960
And I have big eyes so that I can see you better.

36
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,800
That's my text.

37
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,800
Grandmother, why do you suddenly have such big eyes?

38
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,720
So that I can see you better, my child.

39
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,552
And grandmother, why do you have such a terribly big mouth?

40
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,552
So that I can eat you better!

41
00:02:22,552 --> 00:02:24,552
Stay here! I have to eat you!

42
00:02:24,552 --> 00:02:26,552
But I don't even taste it!

43
00:02:29,552 --> 00:02:32,552
If you just run away, you'll ruin the whole play!

44
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:34,552
Then try to catch me!

45
00:02:40,552 --> 00:02:41,552
A break!

46
00:02:41,552 --> 00:02:44,552
I think I'm too old to run after Robin Hood all the time.

47
00:02:44,552 --> 00:02:45,552
That's very good! I...

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I don't want the wolf to eat you anyway.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Well, then don't.

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I also think that our wolf has eaten enough today.

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
At least he swallowed me down.

52
00:02:59,374 --> 00:03:03,174
Do you know what we're going to play next time? We're going to play Snow White.

53
00:03:03,174 --> 00:03:04,974
But we only have the red cap.

54
00:03:04,974 --> 00:03:07,174
Grandmother didn't buy us Snow White.

55
00:03:07,174 --> 00:03:08,474
We? You two?

56
00:03:08,474 --> 00:03:11,074
I think the wolf looks exactly like Snow White.

57
00:03:11,074 --> 00:03:13,174
But he doesn't look like Snow White.

58
00:03:13,174 --> 00:03:14,874
When I was little, I also had a wolf.

59
00:03:14,874 --> 00:03:16,674
I even played Hans im GlÃ¼ck with it.

60
00:03:20,874 --> 00:03:22,174
You poor Snow White.

61
00:03:22,174 --> 00:03:24,374
Maybe you've been enchanted into a wolf.

62
00:03:24,674 --> 00:03:27,174
Maybe you're even a little bit like the Frog King.

63
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:29,174
Poor, ugly wolf.

64
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,300
And what if we make him a dress like it has a red cap?

65
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:36,300
That's definitely not difficult. The dress my doll wears is very simple.

66
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,300
You can now imagine which fairy tale we're playing.

67
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,300
Maybe we can play the story with the roses in the tower.

68
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,300
Do you mean a little rose?

69
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,300
Yes, I think that's what I mean.

70
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,300
If that's what it's like with the cook who sniffs at the earwax, then I mean it.

71
00:03:50,810 --> 00:04:02,710
that's what it's like with the cook who sniffs at the earwax, then I mean it.

72
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:37,542
That's what a wolf has to look like! Now it's much nicer!

73
00:04:45,774 --> 00:04:48,774
Now I have sewn the tablecloth tight.

74
00:04:56,774 --> 00:04:57,774
Wow!

75
00:04:57,774 --> 00:05:00,774
Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow!

76
00:05:00,774 --> 00:05:01,774
Wow!

77
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:07,774
Wow!

78
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:08,774
Wow!

79
00:05:08,774 --> 00:05:09,774
Wow!

80
00:05:09,774 --> 00:05:10,774
Wow!

81
00:05:10,774 --> 00:05:11,774
Wow!

82
00:05:11,774 --> 00:05:13,774
Wow!

83
00:05:13,966 --> 00:05:17,966
Excuse me, please. I didn't know you were here.

84
00:05:17,966 --> 00:05:21,966
I'm always here. What are you hiding behind your back?

85
00:05:21,966 --> 00:05:26,966
Nothing special. I definitely didn't want to scare you. I'm sorry, Miss
Rottenmeier.

86
00:05:28,966 --> 00:05:30,966
What is that supposed to represent?

87
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,966
How disgusting!

88
00:05:36,966 --> 00:05:39,966
What are you doing with the big mouse in the sign of nobility?

89
00:05:40,276 --> 00:05:44,676
That's not a big mouse, that's a wolf. And the grandmother bought it for us to
play.

90
00:05:44,676 --> 00:05:47,376
And I sewed the nice costume he's wearing.

91
00:05:47,376 --> 00:05:49,776
What you don't say. A wolf.

92
00:05:49,776 --> 00:05:53,676
Would you be so kind and explain to me what you're up to with this wolf?

93
00:05:53,676 --> 00:05:57,876
I take it, it's known to you that I don't tame animals in the house, not even
out of fabric.

94
00:05:57,876 --> 00:05:59,076
Give it to me!

95
00:06:00,776 --> 00:06:03,676
Mrs. Sesemann, very nice.

96
00:06:04,476 --> 00:06:05,976
Do you think it's possible?

97
00:06:06,088 --> 00:06:10,088
Of course I think so. I didn't even know you could sew so well.

98
00:06:10,088 --> 00:06:12,688
Very nice. You really did a good job, Heidi.

99
00:06:12,688 --> 00:06:14,688
The wolf is much funnier than he was before.

100
00:06:14,688 --> 00:06:16,688
Come on, we'll show him to Clara.

101
00:06:16,688 --> 00:06:19,688
We'll hold him to the door and make him cry.

102
00:06:21,688 --> 00:06:24,688
It's high time for Mrs. Clara's nap.

103
00:06:24,688 --> 00:06:27,688
I can't wait for her to not go against the rules of this house.

104
00:06:28,152 --> 00:06:30,952
But of course, Mrs. Rottenmeier, I understand what you mean.

105
00:06:30,952 --> 00:06:33,352
You don't want Clara to see this disgusting animal, do you?

106
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:36,952
You called this disgusting handpump disgusting, didn't you?

107
00:06:36,952 --> 00:06:38,552
No, now I know it again.

108
00:06:38,552 --> 00:06:40,352
She even said disgusting.

109
00:06:40,352 --> 00:06:41,352
Am I right?

110
00:06:41,352 --> 00:06:42,352
Yes.

111
00:06:45,352 --> 00:06:49,352
Now just look, Clara, what Heidi made of our wolf.

112
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:58,210
Didn't you want to make him a costume so that he looks like a snail?

113
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:02,210
Yes, it should also be a snail costume.

114
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:06,210
And when I looked at it, it was just a wolf again.

115
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:10,210
The wolf did a particularly good job for that.

116
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:14,210
Maybe we should give your wolf a few drops too.

117
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:18,210
Maybe he'll get so big and strong that he can ride the red cap.

118
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:22,210
Drops again. I only took some earlier.

119
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,592
See you tomorrow, Clara.

120
00:07:23,592 --> 00:07:24,592
Mouth open.

121
00:07:24,592 --> 00:07:27,592
Can't we skip lunch today?

122
00:07:27,592 --> 00:07:29,592
But I don't like it.

123
00:07:29,592 --> 00:07:33,592
Clara, don't make it so hard for us. They don't taste that bad either.

124
00:07:33,592 --> 00:07:35,592
Yes, they taste awful.

125
00:07:35,592 --> 00:07:39,592
Oh, Clara, you're being really mean.

126
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,592
I know what, Grandmother.

127
00:07:41,592 --> 00:07:45,592
I can go to Clara's doctor. Maybe he knows a medicine that tastes better.

128
00:07:45,592 --> 00:07:49,368
I'm sure Clara will take drops that taste good. May I, Grandmother?

129
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:52,608
I don't know, Heidi. Can you be sent on your own?

130
00:07:52,608 --> 00:07:54,488
Do you even dare?

131
00:07:54,488 --> 00:07:56,608
But why not? It's not that hard!

132
00:07:56,608 --> 00:07:57,988
But Johan is supposed to drive!

133
00:07:57,988 --> 00:08:02,128
Maybe the doctor can tell us when Clara can get out of the boring bed again.

134
00:08:02,128 --> 00:08:03,608
Goodbye!

135
00:08:05,248 --> 00:08:09,248
You can be really proud of this friend, Clara. She's especially nice.

136
00:08:09,336 --> 00:08:11,336
Now you're making her happy, too.

137
00:08:11,336 --> 00:08:13,336
What? How can I make her happy?

138
00:08:13,336 --> 00:08:14,336
Very simple.

139
00:08:14,336 --> 00:08:17,336
Take your medicine so you can get out of bed again.

140
00:08:17,336 --> 00:08:20,336
Then you two can play much better together.

141
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:27,546
Drink it, then it will slip better.

142
00:08:28,546 --> 00:08:30,546
It doesn't taste good either.

143
00:08:30,546 --> 00:08:32,546
Disgusting, bitter and disgusting.

144
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:35,546
I know, but it will help you, Clara.

145
00:08:39,022 --> 00:08:40,022
Hello?

146
00:09:09,022 --> 00:09:10,022
Oh.

147
00:09:33,654 --> 00:09:36,654
Aha, who do we have there to visit?

148
00:09:37,654 --> 00:09:40,654
But that's a surprise. Or are you sick?

149
00:09:42,654 --> 00:09:44,654
I think all of a sudden, yes.

150
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:49,654
Oh, that's what you mean.

151
00:09:50,654 --> 00:09:52,654
That doesn't bite.

152
00:09:52,654 --> 00:09:54,654
I thought it was a ghost.

153
00:09:57,814 --> 00:10:04,814
Can't you make the medicine a little sweeter? Maybe Clara will take more of it.
She only takes very little.

154
00:10:04,814 --> 00:10:11,814
Maybe she'll even drink everything at once. If she takes more of this medicine,
she would have to get better faster.

155
00:10:11,814 --> 00:10:15,814
That has nothing to do with it. She has to get healthy on her own.

156
00:10:15,814 --> 00:10:20,814
The medicine I give you can only help her and speed it up a little.

157
00:10:20,814 --> 00:10:24,814
I'm a doctor now and not a magician, even if I would enjoy it.

158
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:29,180
Besides, Clara is only allowed to take as many drops as I write down here.

159
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:34,180
You don't play with medicine, Heidi. If you take too much of it, it can even be
very dangerous.

160
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,180
I'll tell Clara about it later.

161
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:42,180
Clara should actually know that very well. I've explained it to her a hundred
times, but sometimes she just doesn't want to.

162
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:46,180
Well, it's understandable. The poor child sits at home all day.

163
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:49,180
The best thing would be sunshine and fresh air for her.

164
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,180
To be continued

165
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:02,870
Sunshine and fresh air. The doctor said she doesn't need so much medicine.

166
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,870
What she needs is sunshine.

167
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,870
Very simple. So we need sunshine.

168
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,870
Johann, how do you start sunshine?

169
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,870
I don't have the quietest idea.

170
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,870
Then we have to come up with something.

171
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,870
He said Clara needs sunshine.

172
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,870
Sunshine nonsense.

173
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,870
Why? Sunshine is not nonsense. It's something beautiful.

174
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,870
Please Johann, let's take sunshine with us.

175
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,870
So say nobility.

176
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,700
Are you serious?

177
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,700
Yes, we're going to the forest to get the sunshine.

178
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,500
And how, if I may ask?

179
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,900
I don't know yet. I'm already thinking of something.

180
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,500
You just have to take me to the forest.

181
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,900
You don't have to worry about the sunshine.

182
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,500
I'll do it then.

183
00:11:42,306 --> 00:11:44,306
Thank you!

184

185
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:27,150
Heidi, hurry up a little, please.

186
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,650
Otherwise we'll get in trouble with Mrs. Rottenmeier.

187
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,650
I'm just picking a bouquet of flowers.

188
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,650
Why don't you help me, Johann?

189
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:38,650
Picking flowers, that too.

190
00:12:42,986 --> 00:12:45,986
Over there is the little girl from the city. Heidi!

191
00:12:45,986 --> 00:12:47,986
Oh, it's you two!

192
00:12:47,986 --> 00:12:49,986
So you came back after all.

193
00:12:49,986 --> 00:12:50,986
Good day!

194
00:12:50,986 --> 00:12:53,986
Did you leave your girlfriend in the car back there?

195
00:12:53,986 --> 00:12:56,986
Clara had to stay at home. She's sick.

196
00:12:56,986 --> 00:12:58,986
I came here alone today.

197
00:12:59,986 --> 00:13:01,986
Does Clara have to stay in bed all day?

198
00:13:01,986 --> 00:13:05,986
Yes, unfortunately. That's why I'm picking the flower bouquet for her.

199
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:08,986
I know a place where even more beautiful flowers grow.

200
00:13:08,986 --> 00:13:10,986
Yes? Then show it to me!

201
00:13:11,216 --> 00:13:14,216
Do you know where the grandmother always washes the laundry in the stream?

202
00:13:14,216 --> 00:13:16,216
Oh, there you mean!

203
00:13:16,216 --> 00:13:18,216
But then you have to walk a bit.

204
00:13:18,216 --> 00:13:21,216
Come with me, we'll show it to you!

205
00:13:33,216 --> 00:13:35,216
They're there!

206
00:13:35,216 --> 00:13:36,906
Down there!

207
00:13:36,906 --> 00:13:38,906
How beautiful!

208
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:48,890
But they have beautiful colors.

209
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:51,890
That was really worth it. Thank you!

210
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:59,890
You know what? I know something.

211
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:03,890
Come.

212
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:15,058
If Clara could be here and see it all, she'd love it.

213
00:14:25,162 --> 00:14:28,162
I think that the new soap that Lisa brought from the city

214
00:14:28,162 --> 00:14:30,162
washed much better than the old one.

215
00:14:30,162 --> 00:14:32,162
The stains come out much easier.

216
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:35,162
With the other one, you always had to exert yourself.

217
00:14:35,162 --> 00:14:38,162
My arms hurt every time.

218
00:14:45,098 --> 00:14:49,098
There she is. So you can catch her after all. I knew it.

219
00:14:52,098 --> 00:14:56,098
May I take the basket with me? I would like to carry my flowers in it.

220
00:14:56,098 --> 00:14:59,098
I already have so many that they no longer fit into my shirts.

221
00:15:02,098 --> 00:15:06,098
He is not one of us. Take him with you. He has been lying there in the water for
weeks anyway.

222
00:15:06,098 --> 00:15:08,098
Thank you very much.

223
00:15:14,366 --> 00:15:18,366
That's good. We have something here that you need the body for.

224
00:15:18,366 --> 00:15:20,366
You really wanted to have something like that.

225
00:15:20,366 --> 00:15:22,366
Of course, I know what you mean.

226
00:15:25,366 --> 00:15:26,366
Here.

227
00:15:26,366 --> 00:15:27,366
Here.

228
00:15:43,366 --> 00:15:47,366
We did it! They're in there! Caught! We got them!

229
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:04,542
Careful, don't let the lid fall off and they come out.

230
00:16:06,542 --> 00:16:09,542
Thank you, that was really very nice of you two.

231
00:16:09,542 --> 00:16:10,542
Greetings, Clara.

232
00:16:10,542 --> 00:16:12,542
Yes, I'll tell her that they're yours.

233
00:16:12,542 --> 00:16:14,542
Goodbye.

234
00:16:15,498 --> 00:16:18,498
Goodbye.

235
00:16:18,498 --> 00:16:21,498
Goodbye.

236
00:16:21,498 --> 00:16:24,498
Goodbye and thank you.

237
00:16:24,498 --> 00:16:27,498
Live well.

238

239
00:16:47,038 --> 00:16:48,538
Are you finally coming?

240
00:16:48,538 --> 00:16:49,538
Yes.

241
00:16:49,538 --> 00:16:51,538
Where could you have been for so long?

242
00:16:51,538 --> 00:16:54,538
Miss Rottenmeier is getting angry again.

243
00:16:54,538 --> 00:16:57,538
Yes, of course. I'll go and let you in.

244
00:17:02,538 --> 00:17:03,538
Careful!

245
00:17:04,038 --> 00:17:05,538
Oh dear!

246
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:14,538
Don't stumble!

247
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:18,538
Don't stumble!

248
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:25,142
Mrs. Adelheid, take a look.

249
00:17:25,142 --> 00:17:27,142
I'm glad to see you again.

250
00:17:27,142 --> 00:17:30,142
As I was told, you just wanted to go to the doctor.

251
00:17:30,142 --> 00:17:31,142
Two streets further.

252
00:17:33,142 --> 00:17:34,142
What's in this basket?

253
00:17:38,142 --> 00:17:41,142
I want to know right away what's in this basket.

254
00:17:42,142 --> 00:17:43,142
Cats?

255
00:17:43,142 --> 00:17:46,142
Since the child has lost his language, you answer, Johan.

256
00:17:46,142 --> 00:17:50,142
Unfortunately, I have no idea.

257
00:17:50,142 --> 00:17:50,948
That's supposed to be...

258
00:17:50,948 --> 00:17:56,268
a surprise for Clara. You stay out of it, please. So, Johann, what's in the
basket?

259
00:17:56,268 --> 00:18:01,948
Well, I really don't know, unfortunately. That's a secret, too.

260
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:06,348
So, condolences! These kinds of secrets are well known to me.

261
00:18:06,348 --> 00:18:10,708
Most of the time they have four legs, scratch and stink terribly.

262
00:18:14,034 --> 00:18:17,034
Get him out of my sight!

263
00:18:17,034 --> 00:18:18,034
Out!

264
00:18:18,034 --> 00:18:21,034
There are cats in this basket for sure.

265
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:22,034
Am I right?

266
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:23,034
No, you're not right.

267
00:18:23,034 --> 00:18:25,034
I brought a sunshade in this basket.

268
00:18:25,034 --> 00:18:27,034
And a sunshade is good for Clara.

269
00:18:27,034 --> 00:18:29,034
That's what the doctor said.

270
00:18:29,034 --> 00:18:32,034
He said it's not good to sit in the room all the time.

271
00:18:32,034 --> 00:18:34,034
Clara should have a sunshade and fresh air.

272
00:18:34,424 --> 00:18:36,424
And that's why you brought a sunshade.

273
00:18:36,424 --> 00:18:39,424
Oh, Mrs. Sesemann, convince yourself. I'm powerless.

274
00:18:39,424 --> 00:18:42,424
Who knows what this terrible child is holding in the closet?

275
00:18:42,424 --> 00:18:45,424
You heard it. It's a sunshade.

276
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:48,424
Heidi brought a sunshade for Clara because the doctor wants it that way.

277
00:18:48,424 --> 00:18:49,424
I'm in a madhouse.

278
00:18:49,424 --> 00:18:51,424
And maybe there are a few pretty blind fleas in there.

279
00:18:51,424 --> 00:18:53,424
And snakes.

280
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:57,424
No, Mrs. Rottenmeier, there's not a single snake in there.

281
00:18:57,424 --> 00:19:00,424
Oh, what a shame. What is it?

282
00:19:01,424 --> 00:19:02,776
Are they at least fresh?

283
00:19:02,776 --> 00:19:04,776
Frogs always jump around in a funny way.

284
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:09,776
No, they're not frogs. But I can't tell you what it is. It's supposed to be a
surprise.

285
00:19:09,776 --> 00:19:12,776
Be quiet. Otherwise I'll burst with curiosity.

286
00:19:15,776 --> 00:19:18,776
Oh, that's even better than frogs and snakes.

287
00:19:18,776 --> 00:19:21,776
Please, Sebastian, bring the basket to Clara's room.

288
00:19:21,776 --> 00:19:24,776
But be careful, don't let the lid fall off.

289
00:19:25,776 --> 00:19:29,776
And don't shake too much. Be careful when you step on it.

290
00:19:30,344 --> 00:19:33,144
And close the window, so you don't get pulled.

291
00:19:33,144 --> 00:19:35,144
You are very sensitive.

292
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:41,344
Heidi, Heidi, every minute a different idea.

293
00:19:41,344 --> 00:19:44,344
Isn't it wonderful to be so young and carefree?

294
00:19:48,144 --> 00:19:50,144
What do you mean?

295
00:20:20,494 --> 00:20:22,494
I don't know what you're talking about.

296
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:42,306
That was wonderful, Heidi.

297
00:20:42,306 --> 00:20:45,306
Thank you, Heidi. That was a huge surprise.

298
00:20:50,386 --> 00:20:55,886
Oh, that looked wonderful. I will never forget that in my whole life.

299
00:20:58,286 --> 00:21:01,786
Many colorful butterflies, like on a summer meadow.

300
00:21:01,786 --> 00:21:05,786
Look in the basket, Clara. I brought you something nice.

301
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:10,386
The butterflies caught the two boys, but I picked the flowers.

302
00:21:11,786 --> 00:21:16,586
I really want to go back to the forest, Heidi. It was so beautiful there.

303
00:21:16,586 --> 00:21:19,084
But first you have to get healthy.

304
00:21:19,084 --> 00:21:21,084
Yes.

305
00:21:39,084 --> 00:21:41,084
Nice.

306
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:52,966
You will see, Clara is getting stronger every day.

307
00:21:52,966 --> 00:21:56,366
This child from the Swiss mountains is a true blessing for Clara.

308
00:21:56,366 --> 00:21:58,266
This is for all of us.

309
00:21:58,266 --> 00:22:02,666
It is a great relief for me to know that Clara is with Heidi.

310
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:04,666
Now I can drive home in peace.

311
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:07,166
You want to drive again, Mrs. Sesemann?

312
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:10,366
Do the children already know that? How did you take it?

313
00:22:10,366 --> 00:22:11,566
That's it.

314
00:22:11,566 --> 00:22:14,966
I have not yet taken it to heart to tell you.

315
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:19,166
But nothing else will remain for me tomorrow, I have to tell you.

316
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,260
This will be difficult for Clara.

317
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,260
It would be better if you could come here one day forever.

318
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,260
Clara needs you, Mrs. Sesemann.

319
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:53,250
Heidi and Clara still did not know that the beautiful days with their
grandmother should be over soon.

320
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:58,250
Uncompromised, as always, they spent their time playing, singing and telling
stories.

321
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:03,250
None of them thought that the grandmother could leave again one day.

322
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:08,750
But then it was time. Heidi and Clara had to find out the truth.

323
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:14,750
Heidi found the farewell particularly difficult and it seemed as if she could
not comfort anything in the world.

324
00:23:14,892 --> 00:23:18,492
But as always, Mrs. Sesemann knew how to help herself this time as well.

325
00:23:18,492 --> 00:23:21,892
She thought of a surprise for the two of them.

326
00:23:21,892 --> 00:23:26,392
But we want to tell you about it in our next story.

327
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:34,250
Heidi, Heidi, your world is the mountains.

328
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:42,250
Heidi, Heidi, because up here you are at home.

329
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:48,250
Heidi, Heidi, come home.

330
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:55,250
Find your happiness, come back home.

331
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,112
Thanks for watching.
