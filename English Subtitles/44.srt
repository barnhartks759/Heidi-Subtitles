00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:27,886
Heidi, your world are the mountains

3
00:00:27,886 --> 00:00:31,886
Heidi, Heidi

4
00:00:32,886 --> 00:00:35,886
Because up here you are at home

5
00:00:36,886 --> 00:00:43,886
Dark firs, green meadows in the sunshine

6
00:00:44,886 --> 00:00:47,886
Heidi, Heidi

7
00:00:48,886 --> 00:00:51,886
You need to be happy

8
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:56,886
Holadio, Holadio, Holadio, Holadio

00:01:09,886 --> 00:01:10,886
Come home

13
00:01:11,886 --> 00:01:12,886
Find your happiness

14
00:01:13,886 --> 00:01:17,886
Come back home

00:01:28,886 --> 00:01:48,886
Hollywood

16
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,690
Have you been awake?

17
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,690
Yes, for hours.

18
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,690
Do you like it?

19
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,690
Oh yes!

20
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,570
Look at that!

21
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,570
That's wonderful.

22
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:08,570
Nanou?

23
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,570
What?

24
00:02:12,474 --> 00:02:13,474
Good morning, Joseph!

25
00:02:13,474 --> 00:02:14,474
Good morning, Joseph!

26
00:02:16,474 --> 00:02:18,474
What is he looking for?

27
00:02:18,474 --> 00:02:19,474
No idea.

28
00:02:19,474 --> 00:02:21,474
Maybe a snail.

29
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,474
A snail?

30
00:02:22,474 --> 00:02:25,474
He's eating something disgusting.

31
00:02:25,474 --> 00:02:27,474
Do all dogs do that?

32
00:02:27,474 --> 00:02:28,474
I don't know.

33
00:02:28,474 --> 00:02:30,474
A terrifying thought.

34
00:02:30,474 --> 00:02:33,474
Yes, but you get used to it.

35
00:02:33,474 --> 00:02:35,474
Does snails taste good?

36
00:02:35,474 --> 00:02:38,474
Joseph! How do snails taste?

37
00:02:39,632 --> 00:02:43,632
Tell me, have you ever tried one before?

38
00:02:43,632 --> 00:02:45,632
No, really not.

39
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,632
I'll get the grandfather.

40
00:02:47,632 --> 00:02:49,632
Joseph!

41
00:02:51,632 --> 00:02:53,632
Are you really looking for snails?

42
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,632
The grandfather is coming!

43
00:02:55,632 --> 00:02:57,632
Yes, good!

45
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:18,989
What was he looking for?

46
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:21,989
I'd like to know that too, Joseph.

47
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:24,989
Something like that.

48
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:28,989
And then a deep hole.

49
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:31,989
You know what? I think he had no reason at all.

50
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:33,989
Dogs sometimes do such strange things.

51
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:35,989
Possible.

52
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:39,989
Oh, let him be.

53
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:48,989
Look, they're bathing too.

54
00:03:59,765 --> 00:04:03,765
Now I know what you meant when you wanted to let Hansi fly.

55
00:04:04,765 --> 00:04:07,765
I forgot the towel in the bucket.

56
00:04:07,765 --> 00:04:09,765
I'll be right back!

57
00:04:20,213 --> 00:04:21,513
Here's a towel for you.

58
00:04:21,513 --> 00:04:22,113
Thanks.

59
00:04:23,713 --> 00:04:24,313
Here you go.

60
00:04:25,313 --> 00:04:27,313
Nice, icy cold water.

61
00:04:27,313 --> 00:04:30,213
But where do you wash yourself in winter when it's cold outside?

62
00:04:30,213 --> 00:04:33,113
In there, and then Grandfather Snow dives into a bowl.

63
00:04:33,113 --> 00:04:35,313
I'd like to be here in winter too.

64
00:04:35,813 --> 00:04:37,513
Yes, then come in winter.

65
00:04:37,513 --> 00:04:38,013
Yes.

66
00:04:38,513 --> 00:04:40,313
It's best if I don't leave now.

67
00:04:45,045 --> 00:04:50,045
We should also have a well with cold water at home.

68
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:58,037
There, come on. Do you want to come here?

69
00:04:58,037 --> 00:05:00,037
Come to me!

70
00:05:03,733 --> 00:05:08,733
Oh, that's exactly what Peep Mats looked like.

71
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:13,733
Do you know how many birds are in the tub?

72
00:05:13,733 --> 00:05:17,733
No, I have no idea. Maybe a thousand or more.

73
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:19,733
Too many?

74
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:24,733
Oh, what a shame.

75
00:05:24,733 --> 00:05:26,733
Look over there.

76
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:30,733
I can't see anything.

77
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:32,733
It's too late. I think it was a hare.

78
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:34,901
I think it was a hare.

79
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,901
Listen to how they scream

80
00:05:42,261 --> 00:05:45,021
Ah, now they have come, they are thirsty

81
00:05:45,021 --> 00:05:46,021
Ssshht

82
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,416
Why can't she ride?

83
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,416
I won't take her with me.

84
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:04,416
I don't think so.

85
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,416
Peter, wait!

86
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,416
Yes, why?

87
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,416
Be so kind and take me with you.

88
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,416
You know the way.

89
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,416
I want to go up to the hut.

90
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,416
Yes, gladly.

91
00:06:20,528 --> 00:06:24,528
Drink it. It's better than any medicine.

92
00:06:24,528 --> 00:06:28,528
The milk is fresh. He milked it last night.

93
00:06:28,528 --> 00:06:30,528
Hopefully that's not all.

94
00:06:36,528 --> 00:06:38,528
I won. I was faster.

95
00:06:38,528 --> 00:06:40,528
I won. I was faster.

96
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:50,364
Oh, Peter, be so kind and wait. I can't do it as fast as you can.

97
00:06:50,364 --> 00:06:53,864
I can only do it as fast and slowly as my herd can.

98
00:06:53,864 --> 00:06:57,864
Then tell your herd to run slower.

99
00:06:57,864 --> 00:06:59,364
Unfortunately, that's not possible.

100
00:06:59,364 --> 00:07:01,364
So, is it possible now?

101
00:07:05,136 --> 00:07:08,136
Now it works!

102
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:18,704
Please, go away!

103
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:21,704
If you don't want it or you can't, then give the money back!

104
00:07:21,704 --> 00:07:24,704
It's not that steep! Give me the bag already!

105
00:07:24,704 --> 00:07:26,704
I don't want to steal it, I want to wear it!

106
00:07:26,704 --> 00:07:28,704
We're done!

107
00:07:29,704 --> 00:07:31,704
No more cheese bread?

108
00:07:31,704 --> 00:07:32,704
At best I don't want to!

109
00:07:32,704 --> 00:07:34,704
Can we go out and play?

110
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,704
Yes, of course! Can we get up from the table?

111
00:07:36,704 --> 00:07:40,704
Of course! But promise me that you don't go near the slope!

112
00:07:40,704 --> 00:07:42,704
Yes, I promise!

113
00:07:47,632 --> 00:07:49,632
What a tramp!

114
00:07:49,632 --> 00:07:51,632
Wait!

115
00:07:54,632 --> 00:07:56,240
Auntie, did you do something to yourself?

116
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,240
Do you know me? I would like to ask you for reliable advice to leave this kind
in the future.

117
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,240
Oh, you wear these strange shoes from the city.

118
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,240
What's with it?

119
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,240
With it you will break your neck.

120
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,240
I asked you before not to address me so trustfully.

121
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,240
Why? We've known each other for two days. Better walk barefoot.

122
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,240
Do you think I should walk without shoes?

123
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:26,438
You're not going with us, are you?

124
00:08:27,438 --> 00:08:28,438
I don't care.

125
00:08:28,438 --> 00:08:31,438
Peter, you can't leave me here alone!

126
00:08:31,438 --> 00:08:33,438
No, I can't!

127
00:08:36,496 --> 00:08:38,496
How did I deserve that?

128
00:08:41,496 --> 00:08:44,496
And who tells me that they don't bite after all?

129
00:08:53,496 --> 00:08:55,496
Make sure you get out of here, asshole!

130
00:08:55,496 --> 00:08:57,496
Can you give me some old...

131
00:08:57,547 --> 00:09:01,547
What are you doing here? You have to be at the top of the meadow.

132
00:09:01,547 --> 00:09:03,547
I'm sorry, it can't change.

133
00:09:03,547 --> 00:09:05,547
May I have that?

134
00:09:05,547 --> 00:09:07,547
Please? What do you want with it?

135
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,547
I want to give it to her. I'm sorry.

136
00:09:09,547 --> 00:09:11,547
Who do you want to give it to?

137
00:09:17,547 --> 00:09:21,547
Fräulein Rottenmeier!

138
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:24,891
What are you looking for?

139
00:09:24,891 --> 00:09:26,891
Go to the others!

140
00:09:26,891 --> 00:09:28,891
Peter! Peter!

141
00:09:28,891 --> 00:09:30,891
What?

142
00:09:31,211 --> 00:09:34,211
Oh, this monster! Get me out of here! It wants to bite me!

143
00:09:34,211 --> 00:09:36,211
Oh, come on!

144
00:09:40,267 --> 00:09:46,267
They are a bit too small and the color doesn't match my dress, but at least
better than barefoot.

145
00:09:46,267 --> 00:09:49,267
You can't say thank you.

146
00:09:51,267 --> 00:09:53,267
That's funny, what is that?

147
00:09:53,267 --> 00:09:55,267
Just a grasshopper.

148
00:09:55,267 --> 00:09:56,267
Aha.

149
00:09:56,267 --> 00:09:57,267
And that there?

150
00:09:57,267 --> 00:09:59,267
Come.

151
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:00,267
Look!

152
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,267
A marine beetle, yes?

153
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:03,267
Yes.

154
00:10:03,267 --> 00:10:05,267
And now?

155
00:10:05,267 --> 00:10:07,267
Yes, fly!

156
00:10:09,195 --> 00:10:11,195
I think something happened.

157
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:12,195
What?

158
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:14,195
Peter should be here by now.

159
00:10:14,195 --> 00:10:15,195
Yes?

160
00:10:15,195 --> 00:10:16,195
I don't understand.

161
00:10:17,195 --> 00:10:18,195
Yes! He's here!

162
00:10:18,195 --> 00:10:20,195
It's really time!

163
00:10:20,195 --> 00:10:24,195
Peter! Where are you staying so long?

164
00:10:24,195 --> 00:10:28,195
Why are you asking me? Ask your aunt from Frankfurt!

165
00:10:28,195 --> 00:10:30,195
What aunt?

166
00:10:30,251 --> 00:10:32,251
Well, which ones?

167
00:10:32,251 --> 00:10:33,251
My Rottenmeier.

168
00:10:33,251 --> 00:10:35,251
Have you already met her this morning?

169
00:10:35,251 --> 00:10:37,251
Yes, unfortunately I have that.

170
00:10:37,251 --> 00:10:38,251
Yes, and?

171
00:10:43,251 --> 00:10:47,251
If I run one step in these narrow things, I will die.

172
00:10:54,155 --> 00:10:57,155
Not so bad, but it's good that no one sees it.

173
00:11:10,155 --> 00:11:11,155
Mrs. Clara!

174
00:11:11,155 --> 00:11:13,155
For God's sake, you can't do that!

175
00:11:13,155 --> 00:11:14,155
What?

176
00:11:15,155 --> 00:11:16,155
Oh, I got it!

177
00:11:16,619 --> 00:11:19,619
I almost let you out of my sight, something is happening.

178
00:11:19,619 --> 00:11:21,619
You can't possibly sit on the wet ground.

179
00:11:21,619 --> 00:11:23,619
But it's not wet at all.

180
00:11:23,619 --> 00:11:25,619
You can't judge that.

181
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:28,619
Grass is always wet, otherwise it wouldn't be green.

182
00:11:28,619 --> 00:11:29,619
No.

183
00:11:29,619 --> 00:11:31,619
Yes! Oh, sorry.

184
00:11:32,619 --> 00:11:35,619
Mom, you have holes in your socks.

185
00:11:35,619 --> 00:11:37,619
Yes, I have holes.

186
00:11:37,619 --> 00:11:39,619
But still better than these screws.

187
00:11:39,619 --> 00:11:41,619
Don't worry about my feet.

188
00:11:41,777 --> 00:11:43,977
Thank you, Peter, but they're way too small for me.

189
00:11:43,977 --> 00:11:44,977
Too bad.

190
00:11:44,977 --> 00:11:47,977
Yes, unfortunately, I have way too big feet for a lady.

191
00:11:48,977 --> 00:11:50,977
Yes, uh...

192
00:11:53,977 --> 00:11:55,977
I have to have a serious word with you.

193
00:11:55,977 --> 00:11:58,977
Why? What did I do wrong?

194
00:12:00,977 --> 00:12:02,977
Don't say anything. I'll get the grandfather.

195
00:12:02,977 --> 00:12:05,977
No, that's not necessary. Stay here. I don't need any help.

196
00:12:05,977 --> 00:12:07,977
I'm way too heavy for you.

197
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,977
We'll see about that.

198
00:12:10,732 --> 00:12:13,732
Watch out! They're going to drop you!

199
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:16,732
Thank you, Peter. You seem to be very hostile.

200
00:12:23,718 --> 00:12:26,718
I've never seen anything like that.

201
00:12:27,718 --> 00:12:30,718
I just don't know why she's always so upset.

202
00:12:30,718 --> 00:12:32,718
Oh, forget it. Will you do me a favor?

203
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:37,718
Can you bring Swinley and Bearley to the place where the fresh, good herbs grow?

204
00:12:37,718 --> 00:12:41,718
You know, I mean the ones we raised Snooki with back then.

205
00:12:41,718 --> 00:12:44,718
I want the two of them to give particularly good milk.

206
00:12:44,718 --> 00:12:48,718
I understand. You're not going with us today either.

207
00:12:49,718 --> 00:12:50,718
So.

208
00:12:51,276 --> 00:12:56,276
Am i so heavy? Good morning.

209
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:59,276
What do you mean? Good morning.

210
00:12:59,276 --> 00:13:02,276
Why didn't you rent the horse this morning?

211
00:13:02,276 --> 00:13:04,276
I can tell you that, Alm Oehi.

212
00:13:04,276 --> 00:13:07,276
Yesterday evening I had a floe on my bedside.

213
00:13:07,276 --> 00:13:10,276
We live here now in the country.

214
00:13:10,276 --> 00:13:11,276
I have to talk to you.

215
00:13:11,276 --> 00:13:14,276
If you take Mrs. Clara out of the chair next time,

216
00:13:14,276 --> 00:13:16,276
then don't sit her directly on the floor.

217
00:13:16,276 --> 00:13:17,276
Take a blanket or something.

218
00:13:17,276 --> 00:13:19,276
I don't want her to cool down.

219
00:13:19,276 --> 00:13:20,524
Of course.

220
00:13:20,524 --> 00:13:23,024
How did you like to sit on the grass?

221
00:13:23,024 --> 00:13:25,024
Oh, that was really beautiful.

222
00:13:25,024 --> 00:13:28,524
I saw butterflies and grasshoppers and even a sea leopard.

223
00:13:28,524 --> 00:13:29,524
Are those insects?

224
00:13:29,524 --> 00:13:31,024
Oh yes, of course.

225
00:13:31,024 --> 00:13:33,024
Warmth.

226
00:13:33,024 --> 00:13:35,024
Insects can transmit diseases.

227
00:13:35,024 --> 00:13:37,524
You think? Did you read that somewhere?

228
00:13:37,524 --> 00:13:39,024
What?

229
00:13:39,024 --> 00:13:43,024
Clara doesn't need a blanket. It's summer and it's warm. She doesn't get cold.

230
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:45,524
Shamelessness.

231
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:48,024
Can I rely on you?

232
00:13:48,024 --> 00:13:48,358
Yes!

233
00:13:48,358 --> 00:13:50,358
Clara, do you know what?

234
00:13:50,358 --> 00:13:51,358
No, what?

235
00:13:51,358 --> 00:13:53,358
Now the milk is getting better.

236
00:13:53,358 --> 00:13:54,358
Why?

237
00:13:57,358 --> 00:13:59,358
How long have you been living up here?

238
00:13:59,358 --> 00:14:02,358
Oh, so long that I don't even know how many years.

239
00:14:02,358 --> 00:14:05,358
Oh, nice. Really nice.

240
00:14:05,358 --> 00:14:07,358
It's so quiet here.

241
00:14:07,358 --> 00:14:09,358
I wish I could live here too.

242
00:14:10,364 --> 00:14:12,764
Mrs. Clara, it's time for your studies.

243
00:14:12,764 --> 00:14:13,964
Please, no.

244
00:14:13,964 --> 00:14:15,964
Do I have to study in the holidays?

245
00:14:15,964 --> 00:14:19,964
They promised in Frankfurt that they would keep their schedule.

246
00:14:19,964 --> 00:14:22,364
Clara is currently learning.

247
00:14:22,364 --> 00:14:23,364
What do you mean?

248
00:14:23,364 --> 00:14:25,564
In my opinion, she's starting to make holes in the air.

249
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:27,964
She's seeing how someone makes cheese.

250
00:14:27,964 --> 00:14:30,364
That's what I would call learning, for example.

251
00:14:30,364 --> 00:14:31,964
I've never seen that before.

252
00:14:31,964 --> 00:14:34,764
Well, if Clara is interested in it...

253
00:14:34,764 --> 00:14:37,764
I'm going to do it outside, by the way.

254
00:14:38,076 --> 00:14:40,876
I just can't stand the smell of it.

255
00:14:40,876 --> 00:14:42,876
Excuse me.

256
00:14:58,977 --> 00:15:03,297
Oh, oh, oh!

257
00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:05,309
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

258
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:35,309
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

259
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:45,025
Can you drink the water?

260
00:15:45,025 --> 00:15:48,025
Try it. It tastes good.

261
00:15:51,025 --> 00:15:54,025
It tastes awful. You're mean.

262
00:15:55,025 --> 00:15:57,025
She fell in.

263
00:16:05,025 --> 00:16:07,025
She's sleeping.

264
00:16:08,025 --> 00:16:10,025
But don't wake her up.

265
00:16:10,025 --> 00:16:12,025
She's sleeping.

266
00:16:15,025 --> 00:16:15,841
She's sleeping.

267
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:17,841
We want to eat lunch first, then I'll start right away.

268
00:16:17,841 --> 00:16:19,841
We slept for a long time.

269
00:16:32,961 --> 00:16:34,961
I got you!

270
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:38,817
Heidi, I moved all by myself and got a flower!

271
00:16:38,817 --> 00:16:42,817
I even slipped a big piece. The flower was far away.

272
00:16:42,817 --> 00:16:43,817
Did it hurt?

273
00:16:43,817 --> 00:16:46,817
Not at all. It was just very heavy.

274
00:16:46,817 --> 00:16:48,817
I picked the same as you.

275
00:16:48,817 --> 00:16:50,817
That's right, yes.

276
00:16:50,817 --> 00:16:54,817
You know what? We'll pick more and then we'll make a wreath out of it.

277
00:16:54,817 --> 00:16:56,817
A big one for you and a small one for me.

278
00:16:56,817 --> 00:16:58,817
No, two equal sizes.

279
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:00,817
No, I know something better.

280
00:17:00,817 --> 00:17:03,817
I know a place where there are much more beautiful flowers.

281
00:17:03,817 --> 00:17:05,817
There are red and blue and yellow.

282
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:07,817
Shall we go there?

283
00:17:08,817 --> 00:17:10,657
Oh, I could go there.

284
00:17:10,657 --> 00:17:12,657
...picking up a huge straw...

285
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,657
...that must be a lot of fun.

286
00:17:18,657 --> 00:17:20,657
I want to go to the top.

287
00:17:20,657 --> 00:17:22,657
Miss Clara!

288
00:17:22,657 --> 00:17:24,657
Now it's finally time.

289
00:17:24,657 --> 00:17:26,657
Please not today.

290
00:17:26,657 --> 00:17:28,657
Miss Clara, you have to keep your promises.

291
00:17:28,657 --> 00:17:30,657
And you have given one in Frankfurt.

292
00:17:30,657 --> 00:17:32,657
I'm tired.

293
00:17:32,657 --> 00:17:34,657
Then let's have a nap.

294
00:17:34,657 --> 00:17:36,657
I'll lie down too, okay?

295
00:17:40,657 --> 00:17:42,657
To be continued...

296
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,649
Clara?

297
00:17:56,412 --> 00:18:03,412
They're all not used to the air.

298
00:18:12,764 --> 00:18:14,764
It's so beautiful here.

299
00:18:14,764 --> 00:18:17,764
Clara should see all of this.

300
00:18:21,764 --> 00:18:25,660
10, 11, 12...

301
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,660
Twelve. Thirteen.

302
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,660
Tell me, have you run away again?

303
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,660
Come to the others!

304
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,660
Peti?

305
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,660
Heidi, what are you doing here?

306
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,660
I think you're with Clara.

307
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,660
I'm planting flowers.

308
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,660
Clara wants a wreath.

309
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,660
I see.

310
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,660
And where is she?

311
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,660
She fell asleep.

312
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,660
In Frankfurt she always makes a nap, you know.

313
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,660
What?

314
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,660
You can't tell me that.

315
00:18:53,106 --> 00:18:55,106
She's so big and she's still sleeping at noon.

316
00:18:55,106 --> 00:18:59,106
She's at least two years older than us and is being treated like a baby.

317
00:18:59,106 --> 00:19:01,106
Why are you so mean?

318
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:03,106
You keep nagging.

319
00:19:03,106 --> 00:19:05,106
I'm not nagging and I'm not mean.

320
00:19:05,106 --> 00:19:07,106
If you want to know exactly, I'm angry.

321
00:19:07,106 --> 00:19:09,106
Yes, why?

322
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:12,106
I don't even know what I did to you.

323
00:19:12,106 --> 00:19:14,106
Oh, always just Clara.

324
00:19:14,106 --> 00:19:18,106
Aren't you happy that she's with us? I think you like Clara.

325
00:19:18,106 --> 00:19:21,106
I like her too, but she annoys me.

326
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:23,426
No time for me.

327
00:19:25,426 --> 00:19:26,426
Well...

328
00:19:27,426 --> 00:19:29,426
I've got it! You both have to come with me!

329
00:19:29,426 --> 00:19:30,426
That's not possible!

330
00:19:30,426 --> 00:19:31,426
And if it's possible?

331
00:19:31,426 --> 00:19:33,426
She can't walk.

332
00:19:33,426 --> 00:19:36,426
Oh, I see. Then I have to carry her.

333
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,426
Way too heavy.

334
00:19:38,426 --> 00:19:40,426
We'll try it with you!

335
00:19:40,426 --> 00:19:41,426
Yes!

336
00:19:42,426 --> 00:19:45,426
If I can carry you, I can carry Clara for a long time.

337
00:19:45,426 --> 00:19:47,426
How much heavier can she not be?

338
00:19:51,074 --> 00:19:56,614
Haha, haha, haha, hahaha, haha, haha, haha, haha.

339
00:19:56,614 --> 00:19:57,614
That´s okay.

340
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:58,614
But with me.

341
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,274
Clara is a lot bigger than me.

342
00:20:01,274 --> 00:20:04,014
So eat the dinner.

343
00:20:04,014 --> 00:20:05,014
Yippie!

344
00:20:05,014 --> 00:20:08,694
Ah, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, hahaha.

345
00:20:09,372 --> 00:20:11,372
How can we bring her here?

346
00:20:11,372 --> 00:20:13,372
You can't let her fall.

347
00:20:13,372 --> 00:20:15,372
I know.

348
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,780
Oh, Heidi, are you awake already?

349
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,780
You got up. Didn't you sleep?

350
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,780
No, I couldn't sleep.

351
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,780
Did you pick them? Where did you get them all of a sudden?

352
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,780
I was on the flower meadow I told you about.

353
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,780
Beautiful, huh?

354
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,780
And how beautiful they are.

355
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,780
But tomorrow you have to take me with you. Do you promise?

356
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,780
Peter promised to carry you.

357
00:20:57,869 --> 00:21:00,869
That's nice, but I'm too heavy for him.

358
00:21:00,869 --> 00:21:05,869
Oh, I dreamed so beautifully. I was very far up on the mountain.

359
00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:08,869
Did you see mummies in your dream?

360
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:11,869
No, but many thousands of flowers.

361
00:21:23,447 --> 00:21:25,447
Good evening, you two. Were you also brave?

362
00:21:25,447 --> 00:21:28,447
Peter, I have allowed myself to put on my shoes again.

363
00:21:28,447 --> 00:21:29,447
That's good.

364
00:21:29,447 --> 00:21:32,447
Miss Clara, I want us to start with the lesson tomorrow.

365
00:21:32,447 --> 00:21:33,447
Yes.

366
00:21:33,447 --> 00:21:35,447
And please don't forget the medicine.

367
00:21:35,447 --> 00:21:36,447
I'll take it for sure.

368
00:21:36,447 --> 00:21:38,447
I'll be back early tomorrow.

369
00:21:38,447 --> 00:21:40,447
Goodbye, Mr. Oehi, see you tomorrow.

370
00:21:41,447 --> 00:21:43,447
Good, see you tomorrow.

371
00:21:46,447 --> 00:21:48,447
If she comes with me too, I don't want it anymore.

372
00:21:50,447 --> 00:21:51,447
It's okay.

373
00:21:51,575 --> 00:21:53,775
It doesn't matter if she comes with us or not.

374
00:21:53,775 --> 00:21:56,875
Psst! Tell me, what are you two whispering about all of a sudden?

375
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:58,475
Oh, nothing.

376
00:21:58,475 --> 00:21:59,875
Nothing at all, just like that.

377
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,675
Peter wanted to say goodbye to me.

378
00:22:01,675 --> 00:22:02,875
You wanted that, didn't you?

379
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:03,975
Mhm.

380
00:22:03,975 --> 00:22:07,475
Oh, you two are lying. That was something else.

381
00:22:07,475 --> 00:22:09,675
Peter!

382
00:22:09,675 --> 00:22:12,855
Do it! Get out of here, you morons! Disappear! Stand up!

383
00:22:12,855 --> 00:22:14,855
Go! Go!

384
00:22:14,855 --> 00:22:15,855
She needs me!

385
00:22:15,855 --> 00:22:16,855
Goodbye!

386
00:22:16,855 --> 00:22:17,855
Goodbye!

387
00:22:17,855 --> 00:22:18,855
Come back early tomorrow!

388
00:22:18,855 --> 00:22:19,855
I can't take it anymore!

389
00:22:19,855 --> 00:22:20,855
Let go of my hand!

390
00:22:21,855 --> 00:22:22,855
I'm stuck!

391
00:22:30,855 --> 00:22:32,855
Goodbye, Mrs. Rottenmeier!

392
00:22:32,855 --> 00:22:34,855
Don't forget what you promised today!

393
00:22:34,855 --> 00:22:35,855
Be punctual!

394
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:36,855
Goodbye!

395
00:22:42,855 --> 00:22:45,855
To be continued

396
00:22:45,943 --> 00:22:51,943
The next morning Heidi wanted to show the plan of Clara to the girls and finally
put it into action.

397
00:22:51,943 --> 00:22:58,943
As fast as she could, she went down to Brigitte to borrow a pair of old trousers
from Peter for Clara, in which she should feel comfortable.

398
00:22:58,943 --> 00:23:04,943
Brigitte thought Heidi's idea at first was extremely strange, but then she gave
Heidi what she wanted.

399
00:23:07,943 --> 00:23:10,557
Clara was a little embarrassed.

400
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:17,557
But it didn't take long until Heidi had convinced her and Peter was able to
fulfill his promise to carry Clara to the pasture.

401
00:23:17,557 --> 00:23:21,557
But we want to tell you about this in our next story.

402
00:23:22,883 --> 00:23:31,883
Heide, Heide, your world are the mountains.

403
00:23:31,883 --> 00:23:39,883
Heide, Heide, because up here you are at home.

404
00:23:39,883 --> 00:23:45,883
Heide, Heide, come home.

405
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:53,883
Find your happiness, come back home.
