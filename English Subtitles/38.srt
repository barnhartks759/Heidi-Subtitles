Your world are the mountains

Heidi, Heidi

5
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:36,598
Because up here you are at home

00:00:36,598 --> 00:00:40,598
Dark bees

7
00:00:40,598 --> 00:00:44,598
Green meadows in the sunshine

Heidi, Heidi

00:00:48,598 --> 00:00:52,598
You need to be happy

00:01:10,598 --> 00:01:12,598
Come home

19
00:01:12,598 --> 00:01:14,598
Find your happiness

20
00:01:14,598 --> 00:01:18,598
Come back home

21
00:01:28,598 --> 00:01:32,250
Honey, come back home

22
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:40,010
Every day the Almöhi went down to Dörfli and worked on the half-torn house that
he had found for himself and Heidi.

23
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:44,010
This winter he didn't want to stay up in the hut with the child.

24
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:48,250
The Almöhi had decided to send Heidi to school.

25
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:05,210
You can never do that in life until winter. I think so. Imagine the

26
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:09,510
Alp Öhe wants to pull him down in winter. He only does that for Heidi. What he
puts in his head

27
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:16,930
for the Alp is always like that. While the villagers were watching exactly which

28
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:21,130
progress the works at the old house made, Heidi had a lot to do.

29
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,930
She wanted to help her grandfather in her own way. She scrubbed and washed the
laundry.

30
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,882
She didn't want to sit still for a second.

31
00:02:29,882 --> 00:02:34,882
The stable had to be mixed and the spirit brushed

32
00:02:35,882 --> 00:02:38,882
She fed the goats and milked them

33
00:02:38,882 --> 00:02:41,882
Heidi even prepared food

34
00:02:41,882 --> 00:02:47,882
She wanted the grandfather, when he came home in the evening, to be satisfied
with her

35
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:54,902
I'm glad you're back!

36
00:02:57,902 --> 00:02:58,902
Two apples!

37
00:02:58,902 --> 00:02:59,902
Nice! Very good!

38
00:03:03,902 --> 00:03:05,902
All for you, grandfather!

39
00:03:18,902 --> 00:03:20,902
The next day

40
00:03:43,902 --> 00:03:44,902
Wait!

41
00:03:47,902 --> 00:03:48,586
You know what?

42
00:03:48,586 --> 00:03:53,586
We're not staying at home this winter. We're moving into a new house down in the
village.

43
00:03:57,586 --> 00:03:59,586
Are you waiting a moment, Grandfather?

44
00:04:00,586 --> 00:04:03,586
I just have to say goodbye quickly. You know it.

45
00:04:03,586 --> 00:04:06,586
But hurry up and say a nice greeting.

46
00:04:06,586 --> 00:04:07,586
Yes!

47
00:04:08,586 --> 00:04:11,586
I'm going with you. I'll tell you that I'll come home later.

48
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,282
Heidi is coming, big mother!

49
00:04:14,282 --> 00:04:16,282
The Heidi, that's nice.

50
00:04:16,282 --> 00:04:18,282
I just wanted to say goodbye quickly.

51
00:04:18,282 --> 00:04:20,282
We're going down to Dörfli.

52
00:04:20,282 --> 00:04:22,282
I'm supposed to go to school now.

53
00:04:22,282 --> 00:04:24,282
That's good. Then you can read better soon.

54
00:04:24,282 --> 00:04:25,282
Yes.

55
00:04:25,282 --> 00:04:27,282
Will you come and visit us?

56
00:04:27,282 --> 00:04:29,282
You know how long the winters can be up here

57
00:04:29,282 --> 00:04:31,282
if it doesn't stop snowing.

58
00:04:31,282 --> 00:04:34,282
And you always bring us some variety.

59
00:04:34,282 --> 00:04:36,282
Good. As soon as the snow is solid

60
00:04:36,282 --> 00:04:38,282
and Peter gets me with the sled, if he may.

61
00:04:38,282 --> 00:04:40,282
But of course he may.

62
00:04:40,282 --> 00:04:42,282
I have to go now. We want to go down early.

63
00:04:42,384 --> 00:04:47,384
Oh, so you're going to Dörfli today. Peter, will you help carry it?

64
00:04:47,384 --> 00:04:50,384
I'll do it on my own. And I'd love to.

65
00:04:50,384 --> 00:04:51,384
Goodbye.

66
00:04:51,384 --> 00:04:52,384
And see you soon, Heidi.

67
00:04:52,384 --> 00:04:55,384
Have fun at school.

68
00:04:57,384 --> 00:05:02,384
I'm very, very happy that Peter gets along so well with Heidi.

69
00:05:02,384 --> 00:05:05,384
Maybe he'd like to go to school too.

71
00:05:14,154 --> 00:05:20,154
That the palm oil is going down again, I wouldn't have believed it in my dreams.

72
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,154
This is our new house.

73
00:05:23,154 --> 00:05:26,154
In this big house we want to live.

74
00:05:26,154 --> 00:05:27,154
Yes, there.

75
00:05:27,154 --> 00:05:30,154
It's almost as big as the house of Sesemann.

76
00:05:30,154 --> 00:05:32,154
It only has more holes.

77
00:05:34,154 --> 00:05:37,154
But that doesn't matter. Come on, little ghost.

78
00:05:44,154 --> 00:05:47,154
To be continued

79
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,690
He doesn't have a roof on his roof at all.

80
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,190
Look at each other, it's a little better.

81
00:06:00,922 --> 00:06:09,122
Thank you for watching and see you in the next video!

82
00:06:09,178 --> 00:06:11,178
Why are you standing around there? Come on in!

83
00:06:11,178 --> 00:06:13,178
Err... Yes, I'm coming!

84
00:06:33,178 --> 00:06:35,178
This is your stable, little ghost.

85
00:06:35,178 --> 00:06:37,178
This is your stable, little ghost.

86
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:42,690
That looks pretty good, doesn't it? Maybe I'll move in here too.

87
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,402
This house is so huge!

88
00:06:49,402 --> 00:06:51,402
Which room are you in?

89
00:06:51,402 --> 00:06:53,402
Oh, in there.

90
00:06:53,402 --> 00:06:55,402
This is our kitchen.

91
00:06:55,402 --> 00:06:57,402
Yes. And where are the bedrooms?

92
00:06:57,402 --> 00:06:59,402
Go and look for them.

93
00:06:59,402 --> 00:07:01,402
You'll get to know the house soon.

94
00:07:01,402 --> 00:07:03,402
Let's see.

95
00:07:05,402 --> 00:07:07,402
Oh, it's beautiful here.

96
00:07:09,402 --> 00:07:11,402
The grandfather must be sleeping here.

97
00:07:11,402 --> 00:07:13,402
I would never have thought that from the outside.

98
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:17,402
Peter, look at the stove oven.

99
00:07:18,928 --> 00:07:24,928
No, that's my bed. Then I'll sleep in this beautiful room.

100
00:07:24,928 --> 00:07:27,928
But where are you sleeping, grandfather?

101
00:07:27,928 --> 00:07:30,928
Just look around.

102
00:07:30,928 --> 00:07:34,928
In the beginning I was scared, but now I like our new house very much.

103
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:37,928
I think it will be a very nice winter down here, grandfather.

104
00:07:37,928 --> 00:07:40,928
Hopefully, because then the effort would have been worth it.

105
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:43,928
Peter, come in.

106
00:07:44,928 --> 00:07:46,752
This is my room.

107
00:07:46,752 --> 00:07:50,252
Nice. I didn't know that there are such beautiful rooms here.

108
00:07:50,252 --> 00:07:52,252
Me neither. I've known the house for a long time.

109
00:07:52,252 --> 00:07:54,252
But I've only seen it from the outside.

110
00:07:54,252 --> 00:07:56,252
The people in the village say there are ghosts here.

111
00:07:56,252 --> 00:07:58,252
What kind of ghost is that?

112
00:07:58,252 --> 00:08:01,252
Why don't we take a look? Maybe we'll find one.

113
00:08:01,252 --> 00:08:03,252
Come on! Oh yes!

114
00:08:03,252 --> 00:08:05,252
Heidi!

115
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:07,252
No!

116
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:09,386
Is this your room, grandfather?

117
00:08:09,386 --> 00:08:10,386
Yes, I sleep here.

118
00:08:10,386 --> 00:08:12,386
That must have been a very nice room.

119
00:08:12,386 --> 00:08:14,386
Come on, there's more to see.

120
00:08:16,386 --> 00:08:19,386
Such a house ghost would fit in here.

121
00:08:20,386 --> 00:08:24,386
Heidi, how do you know that there are no ghosts anymore?

122
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,190
You think that's funny, don't you?

123
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:35,190
You don't know how funny I think it is!

124
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,190
Watch out, the ghost windows are coming!

125
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:42,190
And I thought there might be a hidden roof somewhere.

126
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,858
Watch out, the ghost windows are coming!

127
00:08:58,858 --> 00:09:00,858
Ghosts!

128
00:09:00,858 --> 00:09:02,858
Two ghosts at once?

129
00:09:02,858 --> 00:09:04,858
Heidi the ghost!

130
00:09:04,858 --> 00:09:07,858
Until today, I've always imagined ghosts differently.

131
00:09:07,858 --> 00:09:10,858
Me too, but I like ghosts very much.

132
00:09:10,858 --> 00:09:11,858
And you, Peter?

133
00:09:11,858 --> 00:09:12,858
Also.

134
00:09:12,858 --> 00:09:16,858
Peter is the only ghost in the world that is constantly hungry.

135
00:09:19,858 --> 00:09:21,858
I think I understand what you want.

136
00:09:21,858 --> 00:09:22,858
May I invite you in?

137
00:09:22,858 --> 00:09:25,600
You super ghost, do you want to eat with us?

138
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,840
Now Heidi is acting as if she doesn't know exactly that you like to stay for
dinner.

139
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,840
Very much, I'm already very hungry.

140
00:09:34,966 --> 00:09:36,966
Me too!

141
00:10:04,966 --> 00:10:06,410
Thanks for watching!

142
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,410
It's starting now.

143
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:11,410
Dirty snow. I have to go home.

144
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,410
Thank you for the food.

145
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:17,410
I have to thank you. You helped me.

146
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:21,410
Tomorrow morning I go to school for the first time. Will you come with me?

147
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,410
Unfortunately not.

148
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:26,410
What? You saw it yourself that it's snowing outside, didn't you?

149
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,410
And?

150
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:31,408
Tomorrow morning everything is wonderful white and that's why I can't go to
school.

151
00:10:31,408 --> 00:10:34,108
I'd rather come here in the afternoon to play, yes?

152
00:10:34,108 --> 00:10:38,108
But if you can come down the mountain to go here, you can also go to school.

153
00:10:38,108 --> 00:10:39,108
Like this?

154
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:44,108
Peter, now you've ruined your own excuse.

155
00:10:45,608 --> 00:10:49,608
So, Peter, you should really be ashamed.

156
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:52,108
At some point you have to learn to read, don't you?

157
00:10:53,108 --> 00:10:54,908
You're welcome to read with me.

158
00:10:54,908 --> 00:10:58,108
No, thank you very much, I don't want that. You have to read yourself.

159
00:10:58,108 --> 00:11:01,108
Do you swear to me high and holy that you will come?

160
00:11:02,304 --> 00:11:04,304
Come on, do it!

161
00:11:05,304 --> 00:11:08,304
It's a promise, and it's a promise, and it's not broken.

162
00:11:08,304 --> 00:11:11,304
I swear to you high and holy.

163
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:13,304
And?

164
00:11:15,304 --> 00:11:17,304
Put your hands up!

165
00:11:17,304 --> 00:11:18,304
Ouch!

166
00:11:18,304 --> 00:11:20,304
That works forever!

167
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,304
Hooray! Hooray!

168
00:11:22,304 --> 00:11:24,106
When are you going to pick me up tomorrow morning?

169
00:11:24,106 --> 00:11:27,106
I would never have trusted you to do that.

170
00:11:28,106 --> 00:11:33,106
I'm sorry. How could you have come up against Heidi's plans?

171
00:11:33,106 --> 00:11:35,106
It's a promise.

172
00:11:36,106 --> 00:11:38,106
You put me in.

173
00:11:38,106 --> 00:11:40,106
Good thing you noticed.

174
00:11:41,106 --> 00:11:42,106
Goodbye!

175
00:11:42,106 --> 00:11:45,106
Not so fast. Here, put it over there.

176
00:11:48,106 --> 00:11:50,106
Thank you all. See you tomorrow.

177
00:11:50,106 --> 00:11:50,710
And don't...

178
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,710
I have a new excuse. No, not until the day after tomorrow.

179

180
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:30,810
For a moment I thought I was in Frankfurt.

181
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:37,810
Oh, I have to get up. Today is my first day of school.

182
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,810
It's still snowing.

183
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:45,810
Peter, please, please come anyway.

184
00:12:56,186 --> 00:13:03,186
Alright, as you wish, Heidi. But believe me, I'll never forgive you.

185
00:13:04,186 --> 00:13:06,186
Where are you going?

186
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:08,186
Why did you get up already?

187
00:13:08,186 --> 00:13:10,186
I have to go to school.

188
00:13:10,186 --> 00:13:13,186
Yes, yes, Heidi finished that too.

189
00:13:13,186 --> 00:13:15,186
Isn't it still too early?

190
00:13:15,186 --> 00:13:18,186
And if I go later, I might think about it again.

191
00:13:18,186 --> 00:13:26,186
And do you know why I'm going? Because Heidi put me in!

192
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:27,108
Disgusting!

193
00:13:27,108 --> 00:13:28,608
Do you understand what he means?

194
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:31,408
Heidi put him in, you heard it!

195
00:13:31,408 --> 00:13:35,908
Peter, please tell Heidi that she is a lovely child and brought you a miracle!

196
00:13:35,908 --> 00:13:37,208
I don't think about it!

197
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:39,508
Cold!

198
00:13:39,908 --> 00:13:41,008
My hat!

199
00:13:41,008 --> 00:13:44,308
Don't be like that. As long as it's snowing, it can't be too cold.

200
00:13:45,508 --> 00:13:46,708
If you knew...

201
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,108
I'll show it to you all!

202
00:13:55,108 --> 00:13:56,308
This year I'll learn how to...

203
00:13:56,346 --> 00:13:59,346
They will be surprised!

204
00:14:04,346 --> 00:14:06,346
The flat ice!

205
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:12,082
Watch out! Now comes a surprise!

206
00:14:12,082 --> 00:14:13,082
Or...

207
00:14:15,082 --> 00:14:18,082
Close it. So, nothing about the school.

208
00:14:24,826 --> 00:14:27,826
What am I going to do now?

209
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:29,826
Has someone run away?

210
00:14:29,826 --> 00:14:32,826
Peter, heaven sent you!

211
00:14:32,864 --> 00:14:35,864
Can you quickly run to the station and bring the bag to the farmer?

212
00:14:35,864 --> 00:14:37,864
No, I have to wait for school.

213
00:14:37,864 --> 00:14:39,864
Then you still have time.

214
00:14:39,864 --> 00:14:41,864
He left the house just a minute ago.

215
00:14:41,864 --> 00:14:44,864
You are still young and fast. You'll get him in easily.

216
00:14:44,864 --> 00:14:46,864
Please, Peter, run!

217
00:14:46,864 --> 00:14:49,864
I don't know. What's promised is promised and won't be broken.

218
00:14:49,864 --> 00:14:51,864
Oh, Peter, come on, I don't understand a word.

219
00:14:51,864 --> 00:14:53,864
We always give you the goats.

220
00:14:53,864 --> 00:14:55,864
I don't even know what the farmer looks like.

221
00:14:55,864 --> 00:14:59,864
But Peter, you see him every morning when you pick up the goats for the pasture.

222
00:14:59,864 --> 00:15:01,864
Here, Peter, take it and hurry up, okay?

223
00:15:02,272 --> 00:15:04,272
Then you talk to Heidi.

224
00:15:04,272 --> 00:15:06,272
What, then you talk to Heidi?

225
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:08,272
Well, then I'll talk to Heidi if you want.

226
00:15:08,272 --> 00:15:10,272
She won't tear my head off right away.

227
00:15:10,272 --> 00:15:11,272
Maybe.

228
00:15:11,272 --> 00:15:13,272
Nonsense, Peter Nunbach.

229
00:15:13,272 --> 00:15:15,272
Well, well.

230
00:15:16,272 --> 00:15:17,272
To the station!

231
00:15:17,272 --> 00:15:19,272
I don't know!

232
00:15:32,272 --> 00:15:34,272
To the station!

233
00:15:38,154 --> 00:15:41,154
That's exactly what I was thinking.

234
00:15:41,154 --> 00:15:43,154
He's already all over the mountains.

235
00:15:43,154 --> 00:15:45,154
Come on.

236
00:15:45,154 --> 00:15:47,154
Let me in first.

237
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:49,154
No, I want to.

238
00:15:50,154 --> 00:15:52,154
Why don't you come in?

239
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,154
Don't you dare?

240
00:15:56,154 --> 00:15:57,154
Yes, but there.

241
00:15:57,154 --> 00:15:58,154
What then?

242
00:15:58,154 --> 00:16:01,154
Man, Heidi, the one from the Alp.

243
00:16:01,154 --> 00:16:03,154
Why are you looking like that?

244
00:16:03,168 --> 00:16:05,168
Three times you have to guess.

245
00:16:05,168 --> 00:16:07,168
I thought she would show up.

246
00:16:07,168 --> 00:16:09,168
That's Heidi?

247
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,168
Is this your first day?

248
00:16:11,168 --> 00:16:13,168
I've never been to a school before.

249
00:16:13,168 --> 00:16:15,168
You were lucky.

250
00:16:15,168 --> 00:16:17,168
It's not worth it to go to school.

251
00:16:17,168 --> 00:16:19,168
It's a lost time.

252
00:16:19,168 --> 00:16:21,168
I saw you coming out of town with your hat on.

253
00:16:21,168 --> 00:16:23,168
Klaas Jürgen!

254
00:16:23,168 --> 00:16:25,168
Sit somewhere else.

255
00:16:25,168 --> 00:16:27,168
Why?

256
00:16:27,168 --> 00:16:29,168
Because it's her place.

257
00:16:29,168 --> 00:16:31,168
I didn't know that. I'm sorry.

258
00:16:32,048 --> 00:16:35,048
You can tell that you haven't been to school yet.

259
00:16:35,048 --> 00:16:37,048
And what if I have?

260
00:16:37,048 --> 00:16:39,048
Tell me which seat I can sit on.

261
00:16:39,048 --> 00:16:43,048
If you haven't been to school, you don't know your grade yet, do you?

262
00:16:43,048 --> 00:16:45,048
No, I can only read.

263
00:16:45,048 --> 00:16:47,048
That's an achievement.

264
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,048
You've all started. Stop it.

265
00:16:50,048 --> 00:16:52,048
Where did you leave your friend Peter?

266
00:16:52,048 --> 00:16:55,048
He must have invented a new expression.

267
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:57,048
Sit down on your seat.

268
00:16:57,048 --> 00:17:01,048
No, I can't take him away. He needs him when he comes.

269
00:17:01,232 --> 00:17:04,232
He's not coming. Don't worry. It snowed yesterday.

270
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:07,232
You don't think he'll let this excuse go?

271
00:17:07,232 --> 00:17:10,232
Peter always complains, even if it doesn't snow.

272
00:17:10,232 --> 00:17:13,232
He's coming today, I know. He told me he was coming.

273
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:16,232
What do you mean? That would be something completely new.

274
00:17:16,232 --> 00:17:19,232
He's coming! He promised me!

275
00:17:19,232 --> 00:17:22,232
Don't get upset. Maybe he'll come when he says so.

276
00:17:28,232 --> 00:17:29,504
Good morning.

277
00:17:29,504 --> 00:17:31,504
Good morning, Mr. Teacher.

278
00:17:33,004 --> 00:17:35,004
Yes, who do we have here?

279
00:17:35,004 --> 00:17:37,004
Children, I can introduce you to Heidi.

280
00:17:37,004 --> 00:17:39,004
She's going to our school from today.

281
00:17:39,004 --> 00:17:41,004
I want you to be nice to her.

282
00:17:41,004 --> 00:17:43,004
Do you understand me?

283
00:17:43,004 --> 00:17:45,004
Yes!

284
00:17:47,004 --> 00:17:49,004
Sit down on Peter's place.

285
00:17:49,004 --> 00:17:51,004
No, I don't want that.

286
00:17:51,004 --> 00:17:53,004
It's not a better day at the moment.

287
00:17:54,004 --> 00:17:57,004
You can sit down. Your Peter won't come today.

288
00:17:57,328 --> 00:18:00,128
Yes, he told me he was coming.

289
00:18:00,128 --> 00:18:03,128
Yes, yes, but it snowed. He won't come, believe me.

290
00:18:03,128 --> 00:18:05,128
No, I don't believe you.

291
00:18:06,728 --> 00:18:08,128
Be quiet.

292
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:12,128
Heidi, be so nice and sit down until he comes.

293
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:19,128
I thought he kept his promise.

294
00:18:25,754 --> 00:18:27,754
Well, the school has started.

295
00:18:27,754 --> 00:18:28,754
Stupid!

296
00:18:32,754 --> 00:18:33,754
Stop!

297
00:18:34,754 --> 00:18:35,754
Stop!

298
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:38,570
Is that my bag?

299
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:40,570
Of course!

300
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,570
Peter, thank you, you saved me.

301
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,570
Now I'll get the next train.

302
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,570
Yes, that's nice.

303
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:48,570
What kind of face are you making?

304
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,570
Oh, you're hungry?

305
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,570
Come on, I'll invite you to my field for dinner.

306
00:18:53,168 --> 00:18:56,868
No, it's not possible. I promised Heidi to be at school on time.

307
00:18:56,868 --> 00:18:57,968
Today's her first day.

308
00:18:57,968 --> 00:19:01,568
What? Forget about school. I was only in school a few times a year.

309
00:19:01,568 --> 00:19:03,768
And I've also become a good student.

310
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:06,368
No, I can't. Not today.

311
00:19:10,368 --> 00:19:12,168
Ten minutes break. Thank you.

312
00:19:15,868 --> 00:19:18,168
And under which bench did your father hide?

313
00:19:18,168 --> 00:19:18,868
Too bad.

314
00:19:18,928 --> 00:19:20,928
He always kept what he promised.

315
00:19:20,928 --> 00:19:23,928
Get used to it. Peter pushes himself wherever he can. He's afraid.

316
00:19:23,928 --> 00:19:26,928
Peter has never been afraid in his life!

317
00:19:26,928 --> 00:19:28,928
Disgusting!

318
00:19:30,928 --> 00:19:32,928
What's wrong with you?

319
00:19:36,928 --> 00:19:39,928
I would never have thought that of you, Peter. No, never!

320
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:43,928
Just so you know, from now on we're no longer friends!

321
00:19:48,928 --> 00:20:00,928
To be continued...

322
00:20:00,954 --> 00:20:03,954
It seems to taste good to you, doesn't it?

323
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,954
Well, what's better?

324
00:20:07,954 --> 00:20:10,954
Something decent to eat or school?

325
00:20:11,954 --> 00:20:14,954
You can still have my leftovers.

326
00:20:14,954 --> 00:20:16,954
Heidi must be mad at me.

327
00:20:16,954 --> 00:20:19,954
I'm not even in school at the last minute.

328
00:20:19,954 --> 00:20:21,954
Tomorrow is school again.

329
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:25,954
Yes, but now I don't dare to go in there at all.

330
00:20:25,954 --> 00:20:26,954
Are you afraid of Heidi?

331
00:20:26,954 --> 00:20:29,824
Tell me, isn't that the little one from our Almöhi?

332
00:20:29,824 --> 00:20:34,824
Keep eating. What difference does it make whether she shouts today or tomorrow?

333
00:20:36,824 --> 00:20:38,824
Give me your hand.

334
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:41,824
There.

335
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:47,130
Thank you very much for bringing me the bag, Peter.

336
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:49,130
My pleasure.

337
00:20:56,794 --> 00:21:01,294
If I have two apples and you have eleven apples, how many do we have?

338
00:21:01,294 --> 00:21:04,794
Together thirteen apples!

339
00:21:04,794 --> 00:21:09,294
Peter, you promised me. You're mean.

340
00:21:09,294 --> 00:21:11,794
Heidi!

341
00:21:11,794 --> 00:21:15,794
Tell me, are you dreaming? Do you not like school that much?

342
00:21:15,794 --> 00:21:17,794
I'm not dreaming.

343
00:21:17,794 --> 00:21:19,794
Oh!

344
00:21:22,294 --> 00:21:24,294
There's Peter! Peter!

345
00:21:24,294 --> 00:21:25,794
But...

346
00:21:25,794 --> 00:21:29,794
Peter! What's wrong, Peter? Are you sick?

347
00:21:31,146 --> 00:21:39,146
I ran all the way from Mayenfeld and now I have side stings and a stomachache
and everything together and a headache.

348
00:21:39,146 --> 00:21:41,146
You were in Mayenfeld?

349
00:21:41,146 --> 00:21:44,146
Yes, but why? What did you do there?

350
00:21:44,146 --> 00:21:48,146
Ah well, Peter. Did you give him the bag?

351
00:21:48,146 --> 00:21:50,146
What's wrong with you, Peter?

352
00:21:50,146 --> 00:21:53,146
He ran up from Mayenfeld to here.

353
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:55,968
You had to go all the way down to Mayenfeld?

354
00:21:55,968 --> 00:21:57,968
Peter, I'm sorry.

355
00:21:57,968 --> 00:21:59,968
Did you send him there? Why?

356
00:21:59,968 --> 00:22:01,968
Oh, the farmer forgot his bag again.

357
00:22:01,968 --> 00:22:05,968
And because I'm not very good at walking, I asked Peter to bring it to him.

358
00:22:05,968 --> 00:22:07,968
Peter.

359
00:22:07,968 --> 00:22:11,968
Peter, you're a sweetheart. You wanted to keep your promise.

360
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:15,968
Mayenfeld! Mayenfeld! Mayenfeld!

361
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:17,482
You keep your promise!

362
00:22:17,482 --> 00:22:21,482
I think you're particularly smart! You're mean and educated and stupid!

363
00:22:21,482 --> 00:22:23,482
Shame on you and your teachers!

364
00:22:24,106 --> 00:22:32,106
Master Grandfather, it's very bad that I told them all this, but I couldn't do
it any other way.

365
00:22:32,106 --> 00:22:34,106
Otherwise I would have burst!

366
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:56,610
In order not to disappoint Heidi, Peter trampled through the deep snow every day
to go to school.

367
00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:05,610
Heidi helped him with the homework, because as much as Peter was suffering, the
numbers and letters did not want to go into his head.

368
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:11,610
Heidi put a lot of effort into it, but Peter preferred to ride a sleigh and plow
through the snow,

369
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:17,610
and after a week he tried to convince Heidi to forget the whole stupid promise.

370
00:23:17,712 --> 00:23:23,912
Because Peter needed every second of the day to prepare for the big annual sled
race.

371
00:23:23,912 --> 00:23:28,112
But we want to tell you about that in our next story.

372
00:23:28,112 --> 00:23:36,312
Heidi, Heidi, your world are the mountains.

373
00:23:36,312 --> 00:23:44,312
Heidi, Heidi, because up here you are at home.

374
00:23:44,312 --> 00:23:50,312
Heidi, Heidi, come home.

375
00:23:50,312 --> 00:23:57,312
Find your happiness, come back home.
