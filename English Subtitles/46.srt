00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:09,150
Hon-la-di-o

2
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:18,350
Hon-la-di-o

3
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:22,510
Heidi

4
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,590
Heidi

5
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:28,430
Your world are the mountains

6
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,750
Heidi

7
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:36,950
Heidi, because up here you are at home

8
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:45,150
Dark fir trees, green meadows in the sunshine

9
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:52,750
Heidi, Heidi, you need to be happy

10
00:00:52,750 --> 00:01:01,150
Highlanders, highlanders, highlanders

11
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:05,910
Lallylally lallylally lallylally

12
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:11,910
Heidi, Heidi, come home

13
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:19,590
Find your happiness, come back again

You're still not on your way?

16
00:01:35,242 --> 00:01:36,242
Yes, I'm almost done.

17
00:01:36,242 --> 00:01:40,242
Hopefully. If you wait any longer, it will be too hot for the goats.

18
00:01:42,242 --> 00:01:44,242
Hurry up, or you'll get in trouble.

19
00:01:44,242 --> 00:01:45,242
Yes, I know.

20
00:01:47,242 --> 00:01:49,242
The dress is good, but why do you need it?

21
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:51,242
Will you please bring me my things?

22
00:01:51,242 --> 00:01:52,242
Yes, with pleasure.

23
00:01:53,242 --> 00:01:54,242
Please don't forget my hat.

24
00:01:54,242 --> 00:01:56,242
No, no, I already have it.

25
00:02:00,346 --> 00:02:03,346
Sometimes I want to know what's going on with him.

26
00:02:03,346 --> 00:02:05,346
Sometimes he's so lazy that he can't move.

27
00:02:05,346 --> 00:02:08,346
And today he's up in the middle of the night to do something.

28
00:02:17,786 --> 00:02:20,786
You seem to have overslept, Peter.

29
00:02:20,786 --> 00:02:21,786
No!

30
00:02:21,786 --> 00:02:23,786
I'll be right there.

31
00:02:23,786 --> 00:02:25,786
Okay, Tantchen, I'll get you.

32
00:02:25,786 --> 00:02:27,786
Tantchen?

33
00:02:37,786 --> 00:02:39,386
Good morning, Joseph. How have you been?

34
00:02:39,386 --> 00:02:42,386
Joseph always sleeps like a moody animal.

35
00:02:52,386 --> 00:02:54,386
Heidi, do you think Peter is...

36
00:02:54,554 --> 00:02:57,054
Got sick because he hasn't come yet?

37
00:02:57,054 --> 00:02:59,054
Ah, good morning, little ghost!

38
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:00,054
Baaah!

39
00:03:01,054 --> 00:03:03,554
Have you at least heard him whistle?

40
00:03:03,554 --> 00:03:04,554
No.

41
00:03:05,554 --> 00:03:07,554
I'm afraid he's sick.

42
00:03:13,149 --> 00:03:15,149
There come these nasty tits again!

43
00:03:25,117 --> 00:03:29,117
I will never win my life against this disgusting beast!

44
00:03:29,117 --> 00:03:32,117
You've lost your way! The way is here!

45
00:03:32,117 --> 00:03:33,117
Peter?

46
00:03:33,117 --> 00:03:34,117
Yes?

47
00:03:37,693 --> 00:03:39,693
Please carry my bag.

48
00:03:41,693 --> 00:03:43,693
It's just the right size.

49
00:03:43,693 --> 00:03:45,693
Come on, let's go.

50
00:03:47,693 --> 00:03:49,693
I really didn't do it for her.

51
00:03:49,693 --> 00:03:51,693
Clara!

52
00:03:53,693 --> 00:03:54,621
Clara!

53
00:03:54,621 --> 00:03:57,121
I've never seen one before. Isn't that funny?

54
00:03:57,121 --> 00:04:00,121
A little bit. At least the colors are funny.

55
00:04:00,621 --> 00:04:03,121
Let's see if I can find another one.

56
00:04:04,121 --> 00:04:06,121
If I only knew.

57
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:08,121
If someone could tell me.

58
00:04:08,121 --> 00:04:11,121
If at least Miss Rottenmeier finally came here.

59
00:04:11,121 --> 00:04:13,121
But do you know if she's sick?

60
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:26,509
He must be sick, otherwise he would be there and everything just because I can't
walk.

61
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:30,509
He was so tired last night, he must have put too much effort into it.

62
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:34,509
I found a snake, should I give it to Joseph or do you want it?

63
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:36,509
Doesn't matter.

64
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:40,509
Peter!

65
00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:43,101
Good morning!

66
00:04:43,101 --> 00:04:49,101
Good morning Heidi, good morning Clara, good morning Peter, where have you been
for so long?

67
00:04:49,101 --> 00:04:49,277
At home.

68
00:04:49,277 --> 00:04:51,277
I had to do something for us!

69
00:05:00,765 --> 00:05:02,765
Can you take my bag, Heidi?

70
00:05:02,765 --> 00:05:05,765
Did you do that so that you can wear the bag better?

71
00:05:05,765 --> 00:05:09,765
Peter, I want to thank you again for yesterday. Are you feeling better today?

72
00:05:09,765 --> 00:05:11,765
I'm not feeling bad at all.

73
00:05:11,765 --> 00:05:15,765
You were too tired yesterday. I thought you were sick.

74
00:05:15,765 --> 00:05:19,765
We really didn't do anything about wearing it. I'm tired.

75
00:05:19,765 --> 00:05:21,765
A little bit of wearing. You wore me.

76
00:05:21,765 --> 00:05:23,765
Are you going to the pasture again today?

77
00:05:23,765 --> 00:05:25,765
Of course we'll come with you. We're going, aren't we?

78
00:05:27,765 --> 00:05:28,765
What is it?

79
00:05:30,765 --> 00:05:32,157
We're going to the pasture.

80
00:05:32,157 --> 00:05:33,157
Good morning.

81
00:05:33,157 --> 00:05:34,157
How are you?

82
00:05:34,157 --> 00:05:35,157
Well, also there.

83
00:05:35,157 --> 00:05:36,157
Oh, good morning.

84
00:05:36,157 --> 00:05:37,157
Good morning.

85
00:05:37,157 --> 00:05:38,157
Good morning.

86
00:05:38,157 --> 00:05:39,157
Good morning.

87
00:05:39,157 --> 00:05:40,157
Good morning.

88
00:05:40,157 --> 00:05:40,957
Good morning.

89
00:05:40,957 --> 00:05:43,957
I'll be right back. I'll get our breakfast.

90
00:05:43,957 --> 00:05:45,957
Oh, Adelheid!

91
00:05:45,957 --> 00:05:47,957
Yes, what is it, Mr. Rottenmeier?

92
00:05:47,957 --> 00:05:50,957
What did you mean by our breakfast?

93
00:05:51,957 --> 00:05:54,957
You want to go back to the pasture, don't you?

94
00:05:54,957 --> 00:05:56,957
Of course!

95
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:59,957
And that I forbade it last night doesn't interest you, does it?

96
00:05:59,957 --> 00:06:02,957
Have you forgotten how tired Clara was yesterday?

97
00:06:02,957 --> 00:06:04,957
Peter carried her, didn't he?

98
00:06:04,957 --> 00:06:06,390
Still!

99
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:09,390
Miss Clara, I assume you're still tired.

100
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:12,390
I'm not tired at all. Not a bit.

101
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,390
Clara wants to go to the flower garden. She liked it.

102
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:20,390
Please listen to me. You will stay here today and rest.

103
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:23,390
Do you understand me? We can study when we have the opportunity.

104
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,390
Yes.

105
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,390
What? You have to stay here today?

106
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,390
Unfortunately, Peter. Today, yes.

107
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,158
But Clara...

108
00:06:33,158 --> 00:06:35,958
Now I've built the frame for nothing.

109
00:06:36,158 --> 00:06:37,958
I'm sorry.

110
00:06:38,758 --> 00:06:41,358
Very nice. I'm very relieved.

111
00:06:41,558 --> 00:06:45,758
I'm glad to see that you've become sensible again, Clara.

112
00:06:46,358 --> 00:06:50,358
That doesn't mean that you have to stay, Heidi. Just go with Peter.

113
00:06:50,558 --> 00:06:52,558
Grandfather!

114
00:06:54,558 --> 00:06:58,558
Don't worry about me. I'm doing my homework today. Go on.

115
00:06:59,358 --> 00:07:02,358
I have to drive the herd to the pasture now.

116
00:07:02,406 --> 00:07:05,406
No, wait a minute. Show me what you're wearing.

117
00:07:06,406 --> 00:07:08,406
It's no longer important.

118
00:07:08,406 --> 00:07:10,406
Why? It looks good.

119
00:07:10,406 --> 00:07:12,406
What did you make it for?

120
00:07:16,406 --> 00:07:19,406
Just tell me, Peter. What did you make it for?

121
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:21,406
Oh, of course, for Clara.

122
00:07:22,406 --> 00:07:24,406
Peter, you're wonderful!

123
00:07:25,406 --> 00:07:27,406
You wanted to wear Clara with it?

124
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:29,406
Who else?

125
00:07:29,406 --> 00:07:31,406
Oh, Peter!

126
00:07:31,814 --> 00:07:34,814
She's strong enough to carry two Claras.

127
00:07:34,814 --> 00:07:38,814
Did you come so late today because you built the carrier?

128
00:07:38,814 --> 00:07:40,814
Ah, yes.

129
00:07:40,814 --> 00:07:43,814
Clara, let's see if we can do it.

130
00:07:43,814 --> 00:07:48,814
Be honest, do you really think you can carry me up the mountain again?

131
00:07:48,814 --> 00:07:50,814
Now tell me, but be honest.

132
00:07:50,814 --> 00:07:53,814
Of course I think I can. Why do you hold me?

133
00:07:53,814 --> 00:07:56,814
That's why I made this carrier for you.

134
00:07:56,814 --> 00:07:58,814
Do you think it will hold me?

135
00:07:58,814 --> 00:08:00,814
We'll both remember that early enough.

136
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:01,558
No way!

137
00:08:01,558 --> 00:08:09,558
I can't allow it! Didn't we just decide to do the homework together and get the
degree?

138
00:08:09,558 --> 00:08:11,558
Ms. Rottenmeier.

139
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:17,558
No, Mr. Oehi, I'm sorry. Please don't interrupt me. You know you have to keep
your promises.

140
00:08:17,558 --> 00:08:21,558
No, I'm sorry, Ms. Rottenmeier, but I'm going.

141
00:08:21,558 --> 00:08:29,558
I never promised not to go. I only promised to get my degree at some point.

142
00:08:29,728 --> 00:08:32,728
Come on, Peter, we'll try the suit, okay?

143
00:08:32,728 --> 00:08:35,728
Good, but promise me that you're not afraid.

144
00:08:35,728 --> 00:08:37,728
Peter, I haven't said yes yet.

145
00:08:37,728 --> 00:08:39,728
I say yes.

146
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:43,728
We'll give Clara a blanket so that she doesn't get cold.

147
00:08:43,728 --> 00:08:45,728
She can still do schoolwork.

148
00:08:45,728 --> 00:08:48,728
But how often has Clara had the opportunity to come to the mountains?

149
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,728
From me.

150
00:08:53,728 --> 00:08:57,728
Well, good. Under the condition that tomorrow is learned, Miss Clara.

151
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:01,331
Did you hear that? I'm allowed to go with you!

152
00:09:01,331 --> 00:09:02,331
Yes!

153
00:09:02,331 --> 00:09:04,331
And Joseph will help you and watch out for the goats.

154
00:09:04,331 --> 00:09:06,331
Then it will be as beautiful as yesterday!

155
00:09:06,331 --> 00:09:08,331
Joseph, come! Joseph!

156
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:21,171
How do you feel up there, Clara?

157
00:09:21,171 --> 00:09:24,171
Like a princess on a wobbly castle tower.

158
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:45,459
Shouldn't we take a break, Peter?

159
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:46,659
No, it's not necessary.

160
00:09:46,659 --> 00:09:48,659
With the carrier it's really going well.

161
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:50,659
But let me know, okay?

162
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:52,659
When you get tired.

163
00:09:55,859 --> 00:09:57,459
Now you have to hold on tight.

164
00:09:57,459 --> 00:09:59,459
Don't fall down.

165
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,339
You can open your eyes again and you too, Reine!

166
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:11,339
Yes! Come on, Joseph!

167
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:15,347
Go on!

168
00:10:17,347 --> 00:10:20,347
I'm sorry that I'm making you such difficulties.

169
00:10:20,347 --> 00:10:21,347
They're not!

170
00:10:21,347 --> 00:10:25,347
I'm so heavy and if I could walk, you wouldn't have to carry me, you know?

171
00:10:25,347 --> 00:10:27,347
You can't normally walk.

172
00:10:28,347 --> 00:10:30,347
Yes, unfortunately.

173
00:10:31,347 --> 00:10:33,347
I want to walk so much.

174
00:10:34,347 --> 00:10:36,347
Get really healthy first, Clara.

175
00:10:37,347 --> 00:10:39,347
Why don't you walk a little slower?

176
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,347
Why?

177
00:10:41,551 --> 00:10:43,551
I don't want to walk a little slower.

178
00:11:11,551 --> 00:11:13,551
Oh no! It's pouring down!

179
00:11:15,939 --> 00:11:17,939
Then we will have to get the children.

180
00:11:17,939 --> 00:11:18,939
Yes.

181
00:11:18,939 --> 00:11:21,939
You will certainly not rest until you are back here.

182
00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:24,939
You do not know what I will do if the poor child gets cold.

183
00:11:24,939 --> 00:11:25,939
What then?

184
00:11:25,939 --> 00:11:28,939
Put on your old pants from me. That's better than complaining.

185
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:30,939
No, please. I think I did not understand correctly.

186
00:11:30,939 --> 00:11:32,939
I want you to put on your old pants from me.

187
00:11:32,939 --> 00:11:35,939
Or do you want to climb around in this elevator outside?

188
00:11:35,939 --> 00:11:38,939
You seem to have forgotten, my dear Almöhi,

189
00:11:38,939 --> 00:11:40,939
that I am a lady with decency.

190

191
00:11:48,323 --> 00:11:51,323
Now come on, no one will see you here.

193
00:12:17,638 --> 00:12:22,638
Would you please go a little bit slower? I can't go any longer.

194
00:12:22,638 --> 00:12:23,638
Good.

195
00:12:26,638 --> 00:12:30,638
I'm not used to the pants. My legs feel very stiff.

196
00:12:30,638 --> 00:12:32,638
I'm glad to believe that.

197
00:12:32,638 --> 00:12:35,638
Would you like us to turn around again?

198
00:12:35,638 --> 00:12:39,638
Oh, for heaven's sake, no! I would be worried about Mrs. Clara coming around.

199
00:12:39,638 --> 00:12:41,638
You're breaking your head for nothing.

200
00:12:41,638 --> 00:12:44,638
In a few minutes it will stop raining again.

201
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:47,100
How do you know that exactly?

202
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,100
Take a look at the sky, it's getting brighter.

203
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,100
You think so?

204
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,100
I don't mean it, I see it.

205
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,100
You have to decide, should we go on or turn around?

206
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,100
No, we definitely don't turn around.

207
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:06,100
After all, I bear the responsibility, I know what my duty is.

208
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,100
You don't know me yet, but I'll never give up.

209
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,100
Follow me.

210
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,590
The road is a bit slippery.

211
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,590
May I help you?

212
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,590
No, thank you.

213
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:25,590
I just wonder why I was trained as a teacher and not as a climber.

214
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,590
And at home he hangs in laundry.

215
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,590
Oh, Clara!

216
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,590
Children!

217
00:13:38,086 --> 00:13:40,086
Heidi! Peter!

218
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:43,086
Fallen in the rain.

219
00:13:43,086 --> 00:13:47,086
Now don't overdo it. Heidi and Peter know each other here.

220
00:13:47,086 --> 00:13:50,086
I just hope it's true what you're saying.

221
00:14:08,086 --> 00:14:11,086
I just hope it's true what you're saying.

222
00:14:11,086 --> 00:14:13,086
I just hope it's true what you're saying.

223
00:14:13,254 --> 00:14:16,254
They took the basket of bread and wine and left.

224
00:14:16,254 --> 00:14:18,254
They walked a long, wide path through a forest.

225
00:14:18,254 --> 00:14:22,254
And then they suddenly came to a forest light with a beautiful flower meadow.

226
00:14:22,254 --> 00:14:23,254
As beautiful as we are.

227
00:14:23,254 --> 00:14:28,254
Many thousand blue bell flowers and yellow key flowers grew on the meadow.

228
00:14:28,254 --> 00:14:34,254
And the little red cap thought that the grandmother could actually pick a flower
bouquet.

229
00:14:34,254 --> 00:14:38,254
The little red cap picked the flowers and suddenly it ran away.

230
00:14:38,254 --> 00:14:40,254
I ran away, it called.

231
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:43,254
I ran away. Where am I?

232
00:14:44,076 --> 00:15:00,076
And suddenly a quiet voice says, come with us. We are the seven dwarfs. We live
behind the seven mountains. We have a little hut and seven beds and seven chairs
and seven plates and seven cups. And we need someone to clean the hut for us.

233
00:15:00,927 --> 00:15:04,927
Wasn't that always Snow White with the dwarfs?

234
00:15:04,927 --> 00:15:07,927
Of course it was Snow White who cleaned it.

235
00:15:07,927 --> 00:15:10,927
Yes, but that was before she got married.

236
00:15:10,927 --> 00:15:12,927
So that's new to me.

237
00:15:12,927 --> 00:15:16,927
You think Little Red Riding Hood paid attention to the dwarfs after Snow White's
wedding?

238
00:15:21,097 --> 00:15:24,097
Sarah is always making her own fairy tales.

239
00:15:26,097 --> 00:15:27,097
It'll be over soon.

240
00:15:27,097 --> 00:15:29,097
It looks like it.

241
00:15:29,941 --> 00:15:31,941
It looks like it.

242
00:16:01,941 --> 00:16:06,941
Clara! Are you okay?

243
00:16:06,941 --> 00:16:07,941
Tell me!

244
00:16:08,521 --> 00:16:10,521
Did you do it on purpose this time?

245
00:16:10,521 --> 00:16:12,521
Definitely not.

246
00:16:12,521 --> 00:16:16,521
So you know, you have to be a little more careful.

247
00:16:16,521 --> 00:16:19,521
Well, I might have been scared just now.

248
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:22,521
My heart is still beating to my neck.

249
00:16:22,521 --> 00:16:26,521
It has to be like that when you're riding a sled in winter.

250
00:16:26,521 --> 00:16:30,521
Look, I slipped from up there to here.

251
00:16:30,521 --> 00:16:33,521
Pretty far. You're completely soaked.

252
00:16:33,521 --> 00:16:34,521
And you too.

253
00:16:34,521 --> 00:16:35,503
Me too.

254
00:16:35,503 --> 00:16:40,503
Yes. Yes, and how? And what now? Drying clothes, what else? And how?

255
00:16:40,503 --> 00:16:45,503
We still have the wool blanket. We can wrap ourselves in it. Wait, I'll get it.

256
00:17:03,817 --> 00:17:05,817
Did they really climb so high?

257
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:09,817
The poor young man could have carried Clara so far away!

258
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,113
We're here.

259
00:17:13,113 --> 00:17:15,113
Oh, yes?

260
00:17:15,113 --> 00:17:17,113
Oh, yes.

261
00:17:17,113 --> 00:17:19,113
Yes.

262
00:17:23,113 --> 00:17:26,113
Hear that? They're alive! They're laughing!

263
00:17:26,473 --> 00:17:30,033
What did I tell you, Mrs. Rottenmeier? You're doing yourself in vain.

264
00:17:30,113 --> 00:17:31,313
Mrs. Klarow!

265
00:17:31,393 --> 00:17:35,313
We dance today, ring-a-ling, ring-a-ling, ring-a-ling

266
00:17:35,393 --> 00:17:39,073
Because today we want to be happy, to be happy

267
00:17:39,153 --> 00:17:43,033
We dance with the bat, ring-a-ling, ring-a-ling

268
00:17:43,113 --> 00:17:46,873
Because today we want to be happy, to be happy

269
00:17:46,953 --> 00:17:50,793
We dance with the bat, ring-a-ling, ring-a-ling

270
00:17:50,873 --> 00:17:54,353
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la

271
00:17:54,353 --> 00:17:58,193
We dance today, ring-a-ling, ring-a-ling, ring-a-ling

272
00:17:58,273 --> 00:17:59,473
The party is still on

273
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,500
Long not out! Long not out!

274
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,500
La-la-la-la-la!

275
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
Miss Clara!

276
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,500
What are you wearing?

277
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:13,500
A pants. You can see that, can't you?

278
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,500
Miss Clara, I am shocked!

279
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,500
You both only have your underpants on!

280
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,500
Of course, our clothes had to dry!

281
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,500
Oh, we're sitting in the rain.

282
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,930
got into it

283
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:35,930
Yes, but we didn't get very wet. Peter built a tent for us and we sat under it
all the time.

284
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:37,930
You'll all get cold. All three of you.

285
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:39,930
No, I'll never get cold.

286
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:40,930
You think so?

287
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,930
Peter is cold.

288
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,930
Where are you going?

289
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:48,930
I hope they really didn't freeze.

290
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:51,930
Have you at least wrapped yourself in the wool blanket?

291
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:52,930
Yes.

292
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:54,930
Oh, look, a rainbow!

293
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:57,930
Heidi, Peter, a rainbow!

294
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:58,930
Oh!

295
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,340
Shame!

296
00:19:10,124 --> 00:19:13,924
Oh, I've never seen one in real life.

297
00:19:13,924 --> 00:19:15,924
It's so beautiful!

298
00:19:15,924 --> 00:19:17,924
Really beautiful.

299
00:19:48,552 --> 00:19:49,472
You, Heidi, you...

300
00:19:49,484 --> 00:19:52,084
Grandmother asks if you can bring Clara with you.

301
00:19:52,084 --> 00:19:55,084
From me? Yes, but I don't know if Clara wants to.

302
00:19:55,084 --> 00:19:57,184
I would like to get to know the grandmother.

303
00:19:57,184 --> 00:20:00,384
Oh yes, then we'll go and visit her tomorrow. May we, grandfather?

304
00:20:00,384 --> 00:20:01,384
From me.

305
00:20:01,384 --> 00:20:02,384
Fine!

306
00:20:10,796 --> 00:20:15,456
In a friendly little town I enter. In the streets lies red evening light.

307
00:20:15,456 --> 00:20:20,636
From an open window just above the richest flower floor you can hear bells
ringing.

308
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:24,876
The world is still calm in the fog, the forest and meadows are still dreaming.

309
00:20:24,876 --> 00:20:28,296
Soon you will see, when the veil falls, the blue sky undisturbed,

310
00:20:28,296 --> 00:20:31,856
the dampened world in warm gold flows vigorously in autumn.

311
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:38,936
I know what you read out. Both poems are by Eduard Mörike and I recognized them
again.

312
00:20:39,394 --> 00:20:45,134
One was the beginning of On a Hike and the other is called September Morning.

313
00:20:45,134 --> 00:20:48,134
I used to learn a lot of poems by heart.

314
00:20:48,134 --> 00:20:53,134
Really? Did you get a reward for every poem you learned by heart?

315
00:20:53,134 --> 00:20:56,134
No, we didn't have any money for that.

316
00:20:56,134 --> 00:20:59,134
I enjoyed it and I said it to her at school.

317
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:04,134
You read well, Clara. You must be a hard-working student with whom everyone is
very satisfied.

318
00:21:04,134 --> 00:21:07,134
No, I can't do math so well.

319
00:21:07,301 --> 00:21:11,101
Me neither. Counting together was fine, but I couldn't take a picture.

320
00:21:11,101 --> 00:21:13,301
I always had to write it off with the others.

321
00:21:16,101 --> 00:21:18,501
Clara, what's wrong with you all of a sudden?

322
00:21:22,959 --> 00:21:27,959
Did you mean that earlier when you said that you liked my lecture?

323
00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:28,959
Yes, of course.

324
00:21:28,959 --> 00:21:31,959
You know what? I often read to you now.

325
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:33,959
Of course, only if you want.

326
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,959
I would be happy about that, but doesn't it strain you too much?

327
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:39,959
Not at all. It was fun for the first time.

328
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:43,959
Reading to you is much nicer. You don't talk in between like my teacher.

329
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:45,959
I don't have to improve you.

330
00:21:47,959 --> 00:21:50,959
I can try to learn one by one.

331
00:21:51,589 --> 00:21:54,589
Try it. Maybe it will be as much fun for you as it will be for me.

332
00:21:54,589 --> 00:21:55,589
You, Heidi?

333
00:21:57,589 --> 00:21:59,589
Tell me, did you actually notice it too?

334
00:22:00,589 --> 00:22:03,589
Today I learned something that others couldn't.

335
00:22:05,589 --> 00:22:09,589
Well, I would laugh at your part if I was happy and not cry.

336
00:22:21,589 --> 00:22:24,431

337
00:22:24,431 --> 00:22:28,431
Can we go back to the meadow tomorrow, when it stays so beautiful?

338
00:22:32,431 --> 00:22:36,431
There, Peter! And friend Rottenmeier!

339
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:53,743
The next morning Peter brought three letters from Dörfle.

340
00:22:53,743 --> 00:22:57,743
One was for Clara, one for Heidi and one for the grandfather.

341
00:22:57,743 --> 00:23:00,743
And all three were written by Clara's grandmother.

342
00:23:00,743 --> 00:23:03,743
Mrs. Sesemann announced her arrival.

343
00:23:03,743 --> 00:23:06,743
Clara could not understand it at first.

344
00:23:06,743 --> 00:23:11,743
Clara and Heidi made plans all day long what they wanted to show the
grandmother.

345
00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:18,709
They remembered the trip they made in Frankfurt and the many funny games that
the grandmother always thought of.

346
00:23:18,709 --> 00:23:24,109
They couldn't wait, it took them way too long until it was finally time.

347
00:23:24,109 --> 00:23:28,509
But we want to tell you about that in our next story.

348
00:23:28,509 --> 00:23:36,509
Heidi, Heidi, your world are the mountains.

349
00:23:36,509 --> 00:23:44,509
Heidi, Heidi, because up here you are at home.

350
00:23:44,509 --> 00:23:50,509
Heidi, Heidi, come home.

351
00:23:50,509 --> 00:23:57,509
Find your happiness, come back again.
