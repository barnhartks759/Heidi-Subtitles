Heidi, Heidi

25
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:12,618
Come home

26
00:01:12,618 --> 00:01:14,618
Find your happiness

27
00:01:14,618 --> 00:01:19,618
Come back again

28
00:01:20,218 --> 00:01:23,218
It has been snowing for days.

29
00:01:23,218 --> 00:01:31,218
Meters high snow covered the rocks and meadows and made it impossible for Heidi
to climb down into the valley to visit Peter's grandmother.

30
00:01:31,218 --> 00:01:36,218
Every morning she wiped the ice flowers off the window and hoped that the sun
would finally rise again.

31
00:01:36,218 --> 00:01:40,218
But she and her grandfather had to wait a long time for that.

32
00:01:40,218 --> 00:01:47,218
The next day

33
00:01:47,218 --> 00:01:49,218
What happened?

34
00:01:49,218 --> 00:01:49,370
The next day

35
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,370
Don't worry, it's me.

36
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:55,370
It's still snowing like out of a bucket.

37
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:01,370
I thought it would be the child who visits me.

38
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:07,370
As soon as it stops snowing, she'll come.

39
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:10,370
You seem to like her very much, Heidi.

40
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,370
I do. She's so cheerful.

41
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:25,370
When it finally stops snowing...

42
00:02:25,466 --> 00:02:28,466
Oh no, so that I can go outside again.

43
00:02:29,466 --> 00:02:31,466
What am I supposed to play?

44
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:34,466
Dogs have good noses, don't they?

45
00:02:34,466 --> 00:02:37,466
Does it smell good when the weather changes again?

46
00:02:38,466 --> 00:02:42,466
You could open your eyes if I talk to you.

47
00:02:44,466 --> 00:02:46,466
You've been living here for so long, grandfather.

48
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:49,466
Do you know when it stops snowing?

49
00:02:49,466 --> 00:02:51,466
No. How should I know?

50
00:02:51,466 --> 00:02:54,256
It's different every year.

51
00:02:54,256 --> 00:02:58,256
Where is nobody? Have you ever tried to ask Schnee himself?

52
00:02:58,256 --> 00:03:02,256
Yes, for years I did, if it didn't want to stop snowing.

53
00:03:02,256 --> 00:03:03,256
And?

54
00:03:03,256 --> 00:03:08,256
No matter how loud I called, he never thought to answer.

55
00:03:08,256 --> 00:03:12,256
Did you just say the truth or do you want to take me on your arm?

56
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:15,256
Why don't you ask Schnee?

57
00:03:16,256 --> 00:03:20,256
There's nothing to laugh about. That's exactly what I'm going to do now.

58
00:03:23,134 --> 00:03:25,134
Snow...

59
00:03:25,134 --> 00:03:27,134
A rabbit!

60
00:03:32,542 --> 00:03:35,542
I'll be right back. I have to go outside quickly.

61
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,790
Have you been waiting for a long time? I completely forgot about you.

62
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,790
Take a look, for you.

63
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,790
Well, does it taste good?

64
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:02,790
Don't worry, there are also a few corns in it. Come down!

65
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,790
Grandfather, it stopped snowing!

66
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,790
It stopped snowing and under the big tree there are a lot of white rabbits!

67
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:22,326
Do you think I can go visit the grandmother again now?

68
00:04:22,326 --> 00:04:24,326
I'm getting dressed.

69
00:04:26,326 --> 00:04:29,326
No, not yet. We will have a snowstorm today.

70
00:04:29,326 --> 00:04:32,326
But it stopped snowing.

71
00:04:32,326 --> 00:04:34,326
Do not be disappointed.

72
00:04:34,326 --> 00:04:36,326
Winter is hard in the mountains, Heidi.

73
00:04:36,326 --> 00:04:38,326
When it snows here, it snows long.

74
00:04:38,326 --> 00:04:41,326
Sometimes many days, sometimes even many weeks.

75
00:04:41,326 --> 00:04:43,326
But you can see the sun.

76
00:04:43,444 --> 00:04:47,444
But you can also see the clouds that tell us that we will soon get a snowstorm.

77
00:04:47,444 --> 00:04:50,444
You will get to know all that.

78
00:04:50,444 --> 00:04:53,444
The weather is not good. Look at the mountains.

79
00:04:53,444 --> 00:04:56,444
They look like you could grab them with your stretched arm.

80
00:04:56,444 --> 00:04:58,444
Then I have to warm the bunnies.

81
00:04:58,444 --> 00:05:01,444
Please let me down from my arm.

82
00:05:01,444 --> 00:05:03,444
I'll be right back. It won't take long.

83
00:05:03,444 --> 00:05:06,444
You, a snowstorm in the mountains, Heidi, is dangerous.

84
00:05:06,444 --> 00:05:09,444
Please hurry up. It can start soon.

85
00:05:09,444 --> 00:05:11,444
Yes, I'll do that.

86
00:05:13,444 --> 00:05:15,070
I'll be right back.

87
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:18,070
I'm sorry for you. You have to go home quickly.

88
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:22,070
Grandfather said we'd get a snowstorm soon.

89
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,070
What was that?

90
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,070
What's going on?

91
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,070
A dog!

92
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,070
A dog!

93
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,070
Come here!

94
00:05:47,358 --> 00:05:49,558
Do it right away, you disgusting dog!

95
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:03,558
Joseph! Joseph! Come back!

96
00:06:04,258 --> 00:06:07,358
That's enough! He won't dare to come here again!

97
00:06:07,558 --> 00:06:09,958
Thank you, Joseph! You did a good thing!

98
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:16,290
Now you are sure. Nothing can happen to him. The dog is gone.

99
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:20,290
You tickle me when you lick. Did the dog hurt you?

100
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,290
Here Eberhard! Here!

101
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,290
The dog has stung a deer.

102
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,290
Go to the side, that's our deer.

103
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:34,290
Now do it, that's dangerous. Why are you standing there as if you had hit the
roots?

104
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,290
Go away!

105
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,290
I'm not going!

106
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:39,290
Nothing else will remain here, so go now, do it!

107
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,290
Our dog has stung it, it belongs to us.

108
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,290
No!

109
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,520
If you do what we tell you, then I have something for you.

110
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,520
You can keep that!

111
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,520
Now get out of the way or you'll get to know me!

112
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,520
No! Do what they say!

113
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,520
Go!

114
00:06:55,746 --> 00:06:59,746
Then I can't help you anymore. I've never seen anything as stubborn as this.

115
00:06:59,746 --> 00:07:03,746
If you want to shoot the deer, you have to shoot me first!

116
00:07:03,746 --> 00:07:06,746
Heidi, you don't know what you're saying! They're really doing it!

117
00:07:06,746 --> 00:07:08,746
Then they should!

118
00:07:08,746 --> 00:07:11,746
Stop with the nonsense! Can't you ever give up in life?!

119
00:07:12,746 --> 00:07:14,746
The boy knows what he's talking about!

120
00:07:14,746 --> 00:07:16,746
Come here, Mr. Heidi! Just one step to the side!

121
00:07:16,746 --> 00:07:22,746
No, I don't think about it at all! I stay where I am! This deer is my friend!

122
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:24,746
That's enough for me! Go to the side or I'll shoot!

123
00:07:24,746 --> 00:07:26,746
They're not doing that!

124
00:07:27,746 --> 00:07:28,746
Heidi, no!

125
00:07:29,026 --> 00:07:31,026
-No! -Should I count to three?

126
00:07:31,026 --> 00:07:33,026
One!

127
00:07:33,026 --> 00:07:35,026
-Baaah!

128
00:07:35,026 --> 00:07:37,026
-Well then...

129
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:41,026
She doesn't seem to be afraid of guns at all.

130
00:07:41,026 --> 00:07:43,026
-Oh, I don't know what else we can do now.

131
00:07:43,026 --> 00:07:45,026
I think we'd better give up Eberhard.

132
00:07:45,026 --> 00:07:47,026
Let's go.

133
00:07:47,026 --> 00:07:49,026
-Oh, that's a nice idea.

134
00:07:49,026 --> 00:07:51,026
Don't move, we're taking a break.

135
00:07:51,026 --> 00:07:53,026
-Ah, I'll be right there.

136
00:07:55,026 --> 00:07:57,026
-Run fast, but look for a dense bush, okay?

137
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:03,946
I have to be your friend? That wasn't very nice of you.

138
00:08:03,946 --> 00:08:06,946
You know very well that I earn money in winter...

139
00:08:06,946 --> 00:08:09,946
Go away and be careful!

140
00:08:09,946 --> 00:08:12,946
Did you understand what I just said?

141
00:08:12,946 --> 00:08:15,946
I'm not for it when it came to me. I didn't choose it as a friend.

142
00:08:15,946 --> 00:08:18,946
Always the same with your animals.

143
00:08:18,946 --> 00:08:20,946
Apparently they are all your friends.

144
00:08:20,946 --> 00:08:22,946
Couldn't you give something up for me?

145
00:08:22,946 --> 00:08:25,946
No, I couldn't do that!

146
00:08:25,946 --> 00:08:28,946
Oh man...

147
00:08:30,242 --> 00:08:35,242
May we come in? A break would be good for us. It's cold outside.

148
00:08:39,242 --> 00:08:42,242
We should stop for today. It doesn't make any sense anymore.

149
00:08:42,242 --> 00:08:45,242
No, we were talking about deers in the village.

150
00:08:45,242 --> 00:08:48,242
I'll only give up if I get one in front of the gun.

151
00:08:48,242 --> 00:08:50,242
Not before.

152
00:08:50,242 --> 00:08:52,242
God bless you, Peter.

153
00:08:52,242 --> 00:08:55,242
God bless you. Are the two of them really in your hut?

154
00:08:55,242 --> 00:08:57,242
Close your eyes, then you can see them.

155
00:08:57,242 --> 00:08:59,242
And you two should come in now.

156
00:08:59,512 --> 00:09:01,512
You're welcome. It's cold.

157
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,790
There's two. There's another one.

158
00:09:17,062 --> 00:09:23,062
Oh, that looks pretty good. We could do something too, the two of us.

159
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:26,062
We'd like to pay for it. What do you want, old man?

160
00:09:26,062 --> 00:09:29,062
There's not enough there for everyone.

161
00:09:29,062 --> 00:09:33,062
What? But there's still enough cheese piled up back there.

162
00:09:33,062 --> 00:09:35,062
I said there's not enough there.

163
00:09:38,062 --> 00:09:40,062
They said it in the village.

164
00:09:42,062 --> 00:09:45,036
Hold on, children, and let it taste good.

165
00:09:45,036 --> 00:09:47,036
Thank you, Grandfather, it will surely taste good.

166
00:09:48,036 --> 00:09:49,036
I'm hungry.

167
00:09:51,036 --> 00:09:52,036
I need the chair.

168
00:09:53,036 --> 00:09:54,036
Yes?

169
00:09:55,036 --> 00:09:56,036
Didn't you understand me?

170
00:09:57,036 --> 00:09:58,036
Yes, that's good.

171
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:05,036
You're right, down in the village. The old man is really crazy.

172
00:10:06,036 --> 00:10:07,036
I first thought it was nonsense.

173
00:10:08,036 --> 00:10:10,036
That's no wonder. He's been living here alone for years.

174
00:10:11,036 --> 00:10:12,036
That's how it is.

175
00:10:13,036 --> 00:10:14,036
Come on, boy, we want to go on.

176
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,340
A little faster. We don't pay you to sit around and eat.

177
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,540
We have to catch at least one deer.

178
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,940
I'll be right there. I just want to eat it.

179
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,740
We'll wait outside.

180
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,340
Maybe we should forget about the deer and go to Steinböcke.

181
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,140
What? But there's going to be a snowstorm.

182
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,740
You have to go home. The grandfather said so.

183
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,140
A snowstorm in the mountains is very dangerous.

184
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,140
You have to be safe right away, right?

185
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,340
Yes, that's right.

186
00:10:42,182 --> 00:10:46,182
It can only last a few hours, and then it starts.

187
00:10:48,182 --> 00:10:50,182
What did I tell you?

188
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:53,182
With the old man, it doesn't really tickle in the head anymore.

189
00:10:53,182 --> 00:10:56,182
The sun is shining outside, and he's talking about the snowstorm.

190
00:10:56,182 --> 00:10:58,182
Maybe you'll be like that in the mountains.

191
00:10:58,182 --> 00:10:59,182
Disgusting!

192
00:10:59,182 --> 00:11:00,182
I think so, too.

193
00:11:00,182 --> 00:11:01,182
Stand up!

194
00:11:01,182 --> 00:11:04,182
We've already told you that you won't be paid for sitting around.

195
00:11:04,182 --> 00:11:05,182
Should I break your legs?

196
00:11:05,182 --> 00:11:07,182
For my sake!

197
00:11:07,182 --> 00:11:09,182
I can't go on with it anymore! I'll stay!

198
00:11:09,182 --> 00:11:11,182
Can you forget your payment?

199
00:11:11,548 --> 00:11:13,548
Good-bye!

200
00:11:15,548 --> 00:11:17,548
We can't just let them go!

201
00:11:19,548 --> 00:11:21,548
Stay here! Don't go on on your own!

202
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:23,548
If the grandfather says there's going to be a snow storm,

203
00:11:23,548 --> 00:11:25,548
then there really is going to be one!

204
00:11:25,548 --> 00:11:25,862
It's too dangerous!

205
00:11:25,862 --> 00:11:28,862
Now you seem to be fantasizing too, little one.

206
00:11:28,862 --> 00:11:32,862
Then look at how close the mountains are. The weather doesn't last long anymore.

207
00:11:32,862 --> 00:11:35,862
Yes, yes, that's good, little one.

208
00:11:54,662 --> 00:11:57,662
I can see him! He's running over there!

209
00:11:57,662 --> 00:11:59,662
I think you've shot him lightly!

210
00:11:59,662 --> 00:12:01,662
Cut him off!

211
00:12:01,662 --> 00:12:04,662
Come here! Here's a trail of sweat!

212
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:22,730
The man is sea, he makes us trouble, but why is it snowing again?

213
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:23,730
Georg!

214
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:28,730
Yes, we have to turn around. If it continues to snow, we will soon no longer see
the hand in front of the eyes.

215
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:30,730
Strange.

216
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:34,730
We can not give up now, I have almost caught the Steinbock.

217
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,730
The dog has him.

218
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:40,730
I do not know right, I do not like the weather at all.

219
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:58,730
Where are you hurrying?

220
00:12:58,794 --> 00:13:01,794
Tell me, should we turn around? I can't see anything anymore.

221
00:13:01,794 --> 00:13:04,794
Why turn around? I think we've been on our way home the whole time.

222
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:23,210
What are you waiting for? The storm won't stop so quickly.

223
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,210
What a waste!

224
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:28,210
What's going on for so many hours? I know that.

225
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:32,210
Tell me, are you scared because you look so shocked?

226
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:35,210
No, but the hunters haven't come back yet.

227
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:38,210
Hopefully they can hide out there somewhere.

228
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:43,210
Stop breaking their heads over the two of them.

229
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:45,210
They didn't deserve it any other way.

230
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:48,928
It has nothing to do with it. It's dangerous out there.

231
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:52,328
You've said it many times, but they didn't want to hear it.

232
00:13:52,528 --> 00:13:54,928
They should see how they're being made out there.

233
00:13:55,128 --> 00:13:57,328
They should show how clever they are.

234
00:14:18,928 --> 00:14:20,928
They should see how clever they are.

235
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:23,128
They should show how clever they are.

236
00:14:23,466 --> 00:14:27,466
That's not the right way. We have to go the other way.

237
00:14:28,466 --> 00:14:31,466
What? You've been saying that for two hours.

238
00:14:31,466 --> 00:14:33,466
Give me some rest and follow me.

239
00:14:47,402 --> 00:14:51,402
My piece of wood will be the tip now. Don't move.

240
00:14:52,402 --> 00:14:55,402
What are the hunters doing now?

241
00:14:57,402 --> 00:15:01,402
I'm sorry, but I have to think about the two of them all the time.

242
00:15:01,402 --> 00:15:04,402
Too bad. This time he will definitely stay standing.

243
00:15:04,402 --> 00:15:07,402
If they run away, they will freeze.

244
00:15:07,604 --> 00:15:10,004
And they have run away, I know that.

245
00:15:10,004 --> 00:15:14,204
If they had found the right way, they would have come by our hut again.

246
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:17,804
Then finally stop. There are other ways down into the valley.

247
00:15:17,804 --> 00:15:22,004
The stupid thing is, slowly it will be time for me to go too.

248
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,604
Be careful, please don't run away.

249
00:15:24,604 --> 00:15:27,804
Don't worry, this is not my first snowstorm.

250
00:15:27,804 --> 00:15:31,604
Up here I know myself, after all, I grew up in the mountains.

251
00:15:31,604 --> 00:15:34,004
Still, I have a very stupid feeling.

252
00:15:34,004 --> 00:15:35,804
Oh, what?

253
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:38,446

254
00:15:38,446 --> 00:15:42,446
Aren't you afraid that something will happen to the two hunters?

255
00:16:00,718 --> 00:16:02,718
Where are you going?

256
00:16:02,718 --> 00:16:05,718
Please stay with Heidi for a moment until I'm back.

257
00:16:05,718 --> 00:16:07,718
Yes, that's fine. I'd love to.

258
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:09,718
I can go home a little later.

259
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,718
Where are you going now?

260
00:16:11,718 --> 00:16:14,718
I want to see the two hunters again.

261
00:16:14,718 --> 00:16:16,718
Oh, thank you, Grandfather.

262
00:16:17,718 --> 00:16:19,718
I'll find them.

263
00:16:20,718 --> 00:16:22,718
Joseph, come on.

264
00:16:22,718 --> 00:16:23,718
You lazy bug.

265
00:16:23,718 --> 00:16:25,718
Get in motion.

266
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:28,586
Be careful, Grandfather. Please.

267
00:16:56,586 --> 00:17:02,586
Hello! Hello! Hey!

268
00:17:09,586 --> 00:17:11,586
Oh, it's cold outside.

269
00:17:15,586 --> 00:17:16,942
Come on, you two, into the water!

270
00:17:16,942 --> 00:17:18,942
The goats must have been too cold in the stable.

271
00:17:18,942 --> 00:17:20,942
They should have warmed up in the fire.

272
00:17:20,942 --> 00:17:22,942
And then we will milk the two.

273
00:17:53,642 --> 00:17:55,642
And then we will milk the two.

274
00:18:25,618 --> 00:18:28,618
Hopefully you both had at least a successful hunt.

275
00:18:29,618 --> 00:18:31,618
Thank God you're here.

276
00:18:31,618 --> 00:18:33,618
If you fall asleep now, you'll freeze.

277
00:18:33,618 --> 00:18:35,618
Come to your senses at last.

278
00:18:44,594 --> 00:18:47,594
The two of them are back where they belong.

279
00:18:50,594 --> 00:18:54,594
If the grandfather comes home, he'll be happy about it.

280
00:19:08,594 --> 00:19:09,594
Help!

281
00:19:14,594 --> 00:19:17,594
Subtitles by Stephanie Geiges

282
00:19:20,274 --> 00:19:23,874
Don't you think the grandfather will stay away for a long time?

283
00:19:23,874 --> 00:19:26,874
Nothing will happen to him, will it?

284
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,830
I don't know.

285
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,830
I don't know.

286
00:20:18,002 --> 00:20:20,002
That's Joseph's grave!

287
00:20:20,002 --> 00:20:21,502
You think so?

288
00:20:21,502 --> 00:20:23,002
But of course!

289
00:20:23,002 --> 00:20:25,002
-Almi! -Grandfather!

290
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:37,502
Yes, they're coming over there!

291
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:40,502
-Grandfather! -He found the two jellies!

292
00:20:40,502 --> 00:20:41,502
Hurrah!

293
00:20:41,502 --> 00:20:43,502
Grandfather, you're finally here!

294
00:20:43,502 --> 00:20:45,502
I was so afraid of you!

295
00:20:45,502 --> 00:20:47,502
Go slowly, Grandfather!

296
00:20:48,882 --> 00:20:50,882
I'll come and help you!

297
00:20:52,882 --> 00:20:55,382
We also set a pot of milk on fire for you!

298
00:20:55,382 --> 00:20:58,382
In which hole did they bury the two of them?

299
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:10,398
Was it dangerous for you? Did you get off the road because it took so long?

300
00:21:10,398 --> 00:21:13,398
No, I had Joseph.

301
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:17,398
Everything went well, don't be afraid, my child.

302
00:21:17,398 --> 00:21:22,398
I'm so happy. If hunters come again, we won't let them go.

303
00:21:27,932 --> 00:21:34,932
Peter spent the night on the hut and when the sun rose the next morning, he and
Heidi roamed down into the valley

304
00:21:35,932 --> 00:21:38,932
Goodbye grandfather, until tonight

305
00:21:38,932 --> 00:21:43,932
The two hunters stayed at the Almöhi for a while to get rid of their fright

306
00:21:45,932 --> 00:21:50,932
Almöhi, I'm sorry, we've been pretty stupid

307
00:21:50,932 --> 00:21:53,932
We behaved like little children

308
00:21:55,116 --> 00:21:59,116
Children behave more reasonably, they listen

309
00:21:59,116 --> 00:22:04,116
I'm not used to it from you, you're all like that, you believe you belong to the
world

310
00:22:08,116 --> 00:22:12,116
If Heidi hadn't been there, the Alp Öhi wouldn't have looked for the two of them

311
00:22:12,116 --> 00:22:15,116
But that's why he didn't have a bad conscience for a long time

312
00:22:15,116 --> 00:22:21,116
He couldn't do anything with these Steters, who make the mountain world insecure
with their guns at the weekend

313
00:22:21,116 --> 00:22:24,460
He just didn't like them and he didn't keep it a secret

314
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:28,460
He knew that he couldn't forbid them to hunt when they had a hunting license

315
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,460
But he himself didn't want to have anything to do with it

316
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,460
Grandmother, we're here!

317
00:22:50,422 --> 00:22:54,422
When the sun was shining, Heidi had a lot of fun in the snow.

318
00:22:54,422 --> 00:23:00,422
She wandered with Joseph through the white winter landscape and took a lot of
time to teach her beloved tree how to speak.

319
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:04,422
Even if she herself didn't really believe that she could do it.

320
00:23:04,422 --> 00:23:07,422
She was on her feet all day to discover something new.

321
00:23:07,422 --> 00:23:12,422
And on one of these streaks she saw the first signs of spring.

322
00:23:12,422 --> 00:23:16,422
Of course she had to describe Peter's grandmother in every detail.

323
00:23:16,422 --> 00:23:19,500
But that wasn't the smallest detail in her vivid description.

324
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:24,260
She told us about the flowers and the melting water, about the Alp Oehi and
about her animals.

325
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:27,260
But we want to tell you about that in our next story.

326
00:23:28,674 --> 00:23:37,174
Heidi, Heidi, your world are the mountains.

327
00:23:37,174 --> 00:23:45,174
Heidi, Heidi, because up here you are at home.

328
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:58,174
Heidi, Heidi, come home, find your happiness, come back home.

329
00:23:58,674 --> 00:24:00,674
To be continued
