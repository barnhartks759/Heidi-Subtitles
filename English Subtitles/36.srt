Holadio

3
00:00:20,462 --> 00:00:24,462
Heidi

4
00:00:24,462 --> 00:00:28,462
Your world are the mountains

5
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:32,462
Heidi

6
00:00:32,462 --> 00:00:36,462
Because up here you are at home

7
00:00:36,462 --> 00:00:40,462
Dark firs

8
00:00:40,462 --> 00:00:44,462
Green meadows in the sunshine

9
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:48,462
Heidi, Heidi

10
00:00:48,462 --> 00:00:52,462
You need to be happy

11
00:00:52,462 --> 00:01:01,462
Holadio

12
00:01:01,462 --> 00:01:02,462
Holadio

13
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:05,462
Holadio

14
00:01:05,462 --> 00:01:09,462
Heidi, Heidi

15
00:01:09,462 --> 00:01:11,462
Come home

16
00:01:11,462 --> 00:01:13,462
Find your happiness

17
00:01:13,462 --> 00:01:18,462
Come back home

18
00:01:32,462 --> 00:01:35,462
You'll have to find a family

19
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:38,462
I wish you the best

20
00:01:38,462 --> 00:01:40,462
Don't worry though

21
00:01:40,462 --> 00:01:42,962
You're not yelling

22
00:01:43,462 --> 00:01:45,462
You just need to find a good place

23
00:01:45,462 --> 00:01:48,462
But you've got to find your friends

24
00:01:48,462 --> 00:01:50,462
I've got a friend

25
00:01:50,462 --> 00:01:53,462
to save you

26
00:01:53,462 --> 00:01:55,462
Honey, don't just go

27
00:01:55,462 --> 00:01:55,770
Keep your eyes open

28
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,770
She's still asleep, and it's not even our Joseph's turn to wake her up.

29
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,770
I'll let her sleep tonight.

30
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:08,770
Now I'm so anxious. She wanted to go to the pasture with me.

31
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,770
To be continued...

32
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:38,130
You can see the valley, the sun is shining.

33
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,130
Wait for her, otherwise she will be angry with me.

34
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,130
Heidi said yesterday that she wants to come with us.

35
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,330
Then you go tomorrow.

36
00:02:50,298 --> 00:02:56,298
I'm back home. I'm not in Frankfurt anymore and I thought I was dreaming.

37
00:03:00,298 --> 00:03:03,298
Good morning, grandfather! Good morning!

38
00:03:05,298 --> 00:03:06,298
Wait, Peter!

39
00:03:06,298 --> 00:03:08,298
What are you doing in front of the stable?

40
00:03:08,298 --> 00:03:10,298
You wanted to take me with you!

41
00:03:10,298 --> 00:03:11,298
Yes!

42
00:03:11,298 --> 00:03:12,298
Yahoo!

43
00:03:13,298 --> 00:03:14,298
Good morning!

44
00:03:14,298 --> 00:03:15,298
Did you finally fall asleep?

45
00:03:15,298 --> 00:03:18,008
You're a nice friend. Just wake up the goats and...

46
00:03:18,008 --> 00:03:20,008
Don't worry, you know I want to go with you.

47
00:03:20,008 --> 00:03:24,008
It's not my fault. I shouldn't have let you fall asleep.

48
00:03:24,008 --> 00:03:26,008
Did the Grandfather say that?

49
00:03:26,008 --> 00:03:28,008
I'll get my breakfast.

50
00:03:30,008 --> 00:03:32,856
Grandfather, can we make breakfast together?

51
00:03:32,856 --> 00:03:36,056
It's been a long time, but it's open, isn't it?

52
00:03:36,056 --> 00:03:38,056
Uh-huh. Thank you, Grandfather!

53
00:03:38,056 --> 00:03:40,056
Peter, watch Heidi!

54
00:03:40,056 --> 00:03:43,056
Yes! I'll watch myself!

55
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,856
Joseph, here! What's the matter? Stay with me! Come on!

56
00:03:46,856 --> 00:03:48,856
Joseph! Here!

57
00:03:49,856 --> 00:03:51,856
This dog is impossible!

58
00:03:52,740 --> 00:04:13,560
La la la la, la la la La la la la la la

59
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,260
Check out this flower greenhouse!

61
00:04:24,888 --> 00:04:27,888
There was no such beautiful flower meadow anywhere.

62
00:04:28,888 --> 00:04:31,608
Peter, can you please hug me?

63
00:04:31,608 --> 00:04:36,608
Because I'm afraid that I'll suddenly wake up and then everything was just a
nice dream.

64
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:38,608
Do I look awake?

65
00:04:38,608 --> 00:04:40,608
Even very, but I'm tired.

66
00:04:42,608 --> 00:04:47,608
If you like this meadow so much, then we can stay for a moment and rest in the
grass.

67
00:04:47,608 --> 00:04:49,608
Oh yes, we'll do that.

68
00:04:52,608 --> 00:04:56,608
Flowers and goats everywhere, some even running up in the sky.

69
00:04:58,404 --> 00:05:00,404
What is it?

70
00:05:00,404 --> 00:05:01,404
You're fine.

71
00:05:01,404 --> 00:05:03,404
Come here, all my clouds!

72
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:05,404
Cloud-herds!

73
00:05:05,404 --> 00:05:07,404
You have to fly into them!

74
00:05:07,404 --> 00:05:09,404
Heidi, watch out where you're running!

75
00:05:28,404 --> 00:05:30,404
Nanou, where's Peter?

76
00:05:30,404 --> 00:05:32,404
Peter?

77
00:05:34,404 --> 00:05:36,404
It's raining flowers!

78
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:40,404
All the best for your birthday!

79
00:05:42,404 --> 00:05:44,404
But I don't have a birthday today!

80
00:05:58,404 --> 00:05:59,404
I'm sorry.

81
00:06:18,404 --> 00:06:19,404
Hurray!

82
00:06:20,404 --> 00:06:21,404
Hurray!

83
00:06:21,404 --> 00:06:22,404
Faster!

84
00:06:28,404 --> 00:06:29,404
Hurray!

85
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:45,404
Hurray! We're here!

86
00:06:50,404 --> 00:06:52,404
I'm the first one here!

87
00:06:59,404 --> 00:07:00,404
I won!

88
00:07:07,404 --> 00:07:08,404
I'm back!

89
00:07:08,404 --> 00:07:09,404
It's still the way it was!

90
00:07:09,404 --> 00:07:11,404
Nothing has changed!

91
00:07:16,404 --> 00:07:17,404
Echo!

92
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,404
I'm home again!

93
00:07:23,404 --> 00:07:25,404
Echo!

94
00:07:29,404 --> 00:07:31,404
First, make sure we have breakfast.

95
00:07:34,404 --> 00:07:35,404
When do we want to have breakfast?

96
00:07:36,404 --> 00:07:37,404
Peter?

97
00:07:38,454 --> 00:07:41,954
I bet you've long forgotten how beautiful the mountains are.

98
00:07:41,954 --> 00:07:44,454
I haven't. How did you find out?

99
00:07:44,454 --> 00:07:46,454
Forget it, Peter.

100
00:07:47,954 --> 00:07:51,454
That's the only thing that has always bothered me about you, Heidi. You never
get hungry.

101
00:07:51,454 --> 00:07:56,454
I asked you earlier when we wanted to have breakfast. And what do you do? You
just lie down.

102
00:07:57,454 --> 00:08:03,454
Oh, well, we can still have breakfast. But who tells us if the sun will still
shine so beautifully afterwards?

103
00:08:03,454 --> 00:08:08,454
I haven't been in a meadow for so long, and I've rarely seen the sun either.

104
00:08:12,054 --> 00:08:15,054
That must have been very strange.

105
00:08:15,054 --> 00:08:17,054
Yes, that was it. And how?

106
00:08:17,054 --> 00:08:22,054
Imagine, no mountains and no trees in front of the house and not even goats.

107
00:08:22,054 --> 00:08:26,054
And you know what? They all feel really comfortable there.

108
00:08:26,054 --> 00:08:28,054
That can't be true.

109
00:08:28,054 --> 00:08:31,054
Yes, you know, they live in big rooms.

110
00:08:31,852 --> 00:08:35,852
Like birds locked in cages, and the windows are always closed.

111
00:08:35,852 --> 00:08:40,852
They have a servant, and a maid, and a teacher, and they all take care of Clara.

112
00:08:40,852 --> 00:08:42,852
Clara is my best friend.

113
00:08:42,852 --> 00:08:43,852
I thought that was me.

114
00:08:43,852 --> 00:08:44,852
Something like that.

115
00:08:44,852 --> 00:08:47,852
Listen, I said friend.

116
00:08:47,852 --> 00:08:49,852
You are my best friend.

117
00:08:49,852 --> 00:08:50,852
Clara is nice.

118
00:08:50,852 --> 00:08:53,852
Mrs. Lenn-Rottenmeier was the only one who wasn't nice to me.

119
00:08:53,852 --> 00:08:59,658
Adelheid, you can't do this, and you can't do that, and you can't do that, and
you can't do that at all.

120
00:08:59,658 --> 00:09:02,658
From morning to night, she's been yelling at me.

121
00:09:04,158 --> 00:09:08,158
Is there so much you can't do all the time?

122
00:09:08,158 --> 00:09:09,158
Uh-huh.

123
00:09:10,158 --> 00:09:11,658
I don't really know.

124
00:09:11,658 --> 00:09:13,158
She's been thinking about something all the time.

125
00:09:13,158 --> 00:09:16,158
Well, that's all over now.

126
00:09:16,158 --> 00:09:17,158
Rottemeier.

127
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:20,158
That sounds like seagull eggs.

128
00:09:22,658 --> 00:09:25,158
She has a very sharp nose.

129
00:09:25,158 --> 00:09:27,158
That's true.

130
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:33,434
If that's all true, then she was pretty mean, Rottenmeier, Rottenreier. If
that's all true, then she was pretty mean, Rottenmeier, Rottenreier.

131
00:09:43,434 --> 00:09:44,916
There you are, Adler! There you are, Adler!

132
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:47,416
You have it good. You can fly.

133
00:09:48,116 --> 00:09:49,416
Peter, look!

134
00:09:50,144 --> 00:09:52,144
Heidi, wait for me.

135
00:10:20,144 --> 00:10:22,144
I'm coming with you!

136
00:10:22,144 --> 00:10:24,116
Clara!

137
00:10:24,116 --> 00:10:26,116
I'll come visit you!

138
00:10:35,732 --> 00:10:41,172
Yes, we are much more beautiful than you told us. I should have gone with you
right away, Heidi.

139
00:10:41,184 --> 00:10:43,184
I should have gone with you right away, Heidi.

140
00:11:11,184 --> 00:11:13,184
I should have gone with you right away, Heidi.

141
00:11:28,276 --> 00:11:30,276
Huh? What is it?

142
00:11:30,276 --> 00:11:34,276
I just had to think about what Mrs. Rottenmeier would say if she saw you eat.

143
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,276
What?

144
00:11:36,276 --> 00:11:40,276
Have you forgotten about my beautiful upbringing again, my dear Peter?

145
00:11:40,276 --> 00:11:42,276
You're like a thorn.

146
00:11:45,276 --> 00:11:47,276
Oh, stop it!

147
00:11:47,276 --> 00:11:49,276
Or do you mean...

148
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:52,276
But you know what? I don't care.

149
00:11:52,276 --> 00:11:54,276
Really? Doesn't it bother you?

150
00:11:54,276 --> 00:11:56,276
Why should it bother me?

151
00:11:56,276 --> 00:11:58,200
Because you've been in town for a long time. Maybe I'm...

152
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,720
I'm not fine enough anymore. But Peter, do you know what I've always dreamed of?

153
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:09,720
That you've eaten 135 rolls. 135? Even I'm getting sick of that thought.

154
00:12:14,546 --> 00:12:17,546
I think I won't feel bad after all.

155
00:12:17,546 --> 00:12:19,546
I thought you could do it!

156
00:12:19,546 --> 00:12:23,546
Yes, I think I can eat 350!

157
00:12:28,274 --> 00:12:31,274
In Frankfurt they buy the milk in the shop.

158
00:12:38,274 --> 00:12:43,274
The little daughter of Schnucki is just as cute as Schnucki when she was little.

159
00:12:43,274 --> 00:12:48,274
Clara only knows all this from pictures, if she could see it.

160
00:12:52,594 --> 00:12:57,594
I always described Snooki as a very small goat, just as I remembered her.

161
00:12:57,594 --> 00:13:01,594
Clara would think I lied to her when she sees that Snooki is so big.

162
00:13:01,594 --> 00:13:02,594
She sees?

163
00:13:02,594 --> 00:13:04,594
Yes, when Clara sees it.

164
00:13:06,594 --> 00:13:09,594
How can that be possible? From Frankfurt all the way here.

165
00:13:09,594 --> 00:13:11,594
There is no binoculars that can see that far.

166
00:13:11,594 --> 00:13:12,594
Snooki, come!

167
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:16,594
She's actually coming.

168
00:13:16,594 --> 00:13:17,594
That's funny.

169
00:13:20,648 --> 00:13:22,648
Because whatever you are, I'll call you Snuggie too.

170
00:13:22,648 --> 00:13:24,648
Understood, Snuggie 1?

171
00:13:25,648 --> 00:13:27,648
And you too, Snuggie 2?

172
00:13:28,648 --> 00:13:30,648
From now on, they'll all be called Snuggie.

173
00:13:31,648 --> 00:13:33,648
Is there anything else you want to know?

174
00:13:33,648 --> 00:13:36,648
No, it doesn't matter. Come with me, I want to show you something.

175
00:13:36,648 --> 00:13:37,648
A surprise?

176
00:13:37,648 --> 00:13:39,648
Yes, even one that you'll like.

177
00:13:39,648 --> 00:13:40,648
Then show me.

178
00:13:40,648 --> 00:13:42,648
Get a grip on yourself.

179
00:13:50,648 --> 00:13:52,648
Psst, be quiet.

180
00:13:54,648 --> 00:13:55,648
Right away.

181
00:13:57,648 --> 00:13:58,648
Over there.

182
00:13:58,648 --> 00:13:59,648
Where?

183
00:14:00,648 --> 00:14:01,648
Back there.

184
00:14:10,226 --> 00:14:12,226
Oh, a bird nest!

185
00:14:14,726 --> 00:14:16,726
Maybe they belong to Peep.

186
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,810
They're cute, aren't they?

187
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,810
They must be Peeb's.

188
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:27,810
The mother, there!

189
00:14:34,514 --> 00:14:38,514
Such a big worm, it doesn't go in.

190
00:14:40,514 --> 00:14:44,514
Yes, just like back then with Peep Matz.

191
00:14:48,562 --> 00:14:51,562
Little peep-mutt.

192
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:57,562
We have to go back.

193
00:14:57,562 --> 00:14:58,562
Already.

194
00:14:58,576 --> 00:15:01,576
The goats have been alone for too long.

195
00:15:01,576 --> 00:15:03,576
Come with us, Heidi.

196
00:15:03,576 --> 00:15:06,576
If you want, we can go back tomorrow.

197
00:15:06,576 --> 00:15:09,576
Goodbye, you little pussies.

198
00:15:14,224 --> 00:15:16,224
Thank you, Peter.

199
00:15:20,224 --> 00:15:23,224
I thought you liked it. And you know what?

200
00:15:23,224 --> 00:15:27,224
Your stupid friend Clara wouldn't have been able to show it to you.

201
00:15:27,224 --> 00:15:29,224
That's the best part about it.

202
00:15:30,224 --> 00:15:31,224
Peter?

203
00:15:31,224 --> 00:15:32,224
Yes?

204
00:15:32,224 --> 00:15:33,224
You're mean!

205
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:34,224
Ouch!

206
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:35,224
Oh dear.

207
00:15:35,224 --> 00:15:36,224
Ouch.

208
00:15:36,224 --> 00:15:38,224
Excuse me, are you badly hurt?

209
00:15:38,224 --> 00:15:41,224
Fall in! Fall in!

210
00:15:44,224 --> 00:15:45,224
Yippie!

211
00:15:45,616 --> 00:15:47,616
Look at the little birds!

212
00:15:47,616 --> 00:15:49,616
Look at them!

213
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,616
How beautiful they are!

214
00:15:51,616 --> 00:15:53,616
Especially the little colorful ones!

215
00:15:53,616 --> 00:15:55,616
There are no colorful ones.

216
00:15:55,616 --> 00:15:57,616
What?

217
00:15:57,616 --> 00:15:59,616
Oh, my! That's one of ours!

218
00:15:59,616 --> 00:16:01,616
A goat?

219
00:16:01,616 --> 00:16:03,616
That's not good!

220
00:16:03,616 --> 00:16:05,616
It's never good!

221
00:16:05,616 --> 00:16:07,616
Peter, help us!

222
00:16:07,616 --> 00:16:09,616
How?

223
00:16:11,616 --> 00:16:13,616
Come back!

224
00:16:13,616 --> 00:16:15,616
Here we are!

225
00:16:15,616 --> 00:16:17,616
Here! Watch out!

226
00:16:18,224 --> 00:16:20,224
I'm really scared!

227
00:16:22,224 --> 00:16:26,224
No! She's running away! But I won't let that happen!

228
00:16:26,224 --> 00:16:29,224
Peter! What does she want with the boulders?

229
00:16:29,224 --> 00:16:33,224
I don't know. She just wants to run away. That's what Bunte does all the time.
But I won't let it happen!

230
00:16:34,224 --> 00:16:37,224
Bunte!

231
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,440
Over there in the shop, they say that the Almy would have bought the child a new
dress.

232
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,440
She brought a whole suitcase with her.

233
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,440
I thought that the old man wouldn't dare to come in.

234
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,440
Hello.

235
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,440
Long time no see, Almy.

236
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,440
The child says you're opening a suitcase for her.

237
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,440
Yes, and what a fine one, made of leather.

238
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,440
Come on, old man, go and get it.

239
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,670
Do you trade bread?

240
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:14,670
Yes, I've never let a good business go to waste.

241
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,670
Then do it.

242
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,670
So, the suitcase.

243
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,670
Yes, we haven't seen each other in a long time.

244
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,670
So come on and have some bread from us.

245
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:24,670
Here.

246
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,670
That makes me very happy.

247
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,670
A nice girl, the little one you have there with you.

248
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:30,670
I know her.

249
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,670
I recently took her with me in my horse carriage.

250
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:37,670
She was dressed wonderfully and looked like a lady from the city.

251
00:17:37,734 --> 00:17:39,734
A lady from the city.

252
00:17:41,734 --> 00:17:43,734
What a joke you always make.

253
00:17:45,734 --> 00:17:47,734
Thank you for picking up the suitcase.

254
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,734
You're welcome. No problem.

255
00:17:51,734 --> 00:17:53,734
A lady from the city.

256
00:17:56,734 --> 00:17:58,734
I heard him laugh for the first time today.

257
00:17:59,734 --> 00:18:01,734
And we've known him for so long.

258
00:18:07,734 --> 00:18:10,734
Subtitles by Stephanie Geiges

259
00:18:13,262 --> 00:18:16,262
I don't think we'll catch them again.

260
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:19,262
I have to. I have nothing else left.

261
00:18:20,442 --> 00:18:22,442
Don't jump!

262
00:18:22,442 --> 00:18:24,442
Stop! You can't do that! Stay!

263
00:18:24,442 --> 00:18:26,442
You're falling into the water!

264
00:18:26,442 --> 00:18:28,442
Wait! I'll come and help!

265
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:30,442
Hurry up! She's standing there so strangely!

266
00:18:50,442 --> 00:18:52,442
I'm up there! Thank you!

267
00:19:16,442 --> 00:19:18,442
A lake!

268
00:19:18,442 --> 00:19:20,442
A mountain lake!

269
00:19:20,442 --> 00:19:22,442
A lake!

270
00:19:24,442 --> 00:19:26,442
There she is!

271
00:19:28,442 --> 00:19:30,442
Hey you!

272
00:19:30,442 --> 00:19:32,442
What are you doing?

273
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:35,550
Without it, we wouldn't have found the lake.

274
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,550
Right, you're right.

275
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:40,550
Not even I knew that there was such a beautiful lake up here.

276
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,550
And everything on my first day.

277
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,550
It's cold.

278
00:19:58,126 --> 00:20:00,126
Colder than our fountain water.

279
00:20:00,126 --> 00:20:01,126
You think so?

280
00:20:01,126 --> 00:20:03,126
But come on, we have to go.

281
00:20:03,126 --> 00:20:04,126
Already?

282
00:20:04,126 --> 00:20:06,126
Yes, I'm sorry too.

283
00:20:06,126 --> 00:20:09,126
But we can't leave our herd alone for so long.

284
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:10,126
Oh, why?

285
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,126
Let them run away.

286
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,126
Heidi.

287
00:20:12,126 --> 00:20:15,126
Oh, you'd better look around.

288
00:20:15,126 --> 00:20:29,038
A sunset. Everything is clear.

289
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:32,038
The most beautiful sunset in the world!

290
00:20:33,114 --> 00:20:35,114
I hope you enjoyed the movie!

291
00:21:03,114 --> 00:21:05,114
No, don't catch me. I had to do something first.

292
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:21,244
There is a lake.

293
00:21:21,244 --> 00:21:23,244
You were so far up.

294
00:21:23,244 --> 00:21:26,244
Yes, and then the sun went down and the mountains lit up.

295
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:29,244
Yes, nice. But now guess what I have.

296
00:21:29,244 --> 00:21:31,244
What? My suitcase?

297
00:21:34,244 --> 00:21:36,244
A new dress.

298
00:21:36,244 --> 00:21:39,244
Yes, just like your old one.

299
00:21:39,244 --> 00:21:41,244
Thank you, grandfather, I wished that.

300
00:21:41,244 --> 00:21:43,244
That's much nicer than the others.

301
00:21:43,244 --> 00:21:46,244
In Frankfurt I was never allowed to wear my old dress.

302
00:21:46,244 --> 00:21:48,244
Close your eyes.

303
00:21:48,258 --> 00:21:50,258
If you want to.

304
00:21:50,258 --> 00:21:52,258
Are you closed?

305
00:21:56,076 --> 00:21:58,076
And now open it again.

306
00:22:02,076 --> 00:22:03,076
Well, and?

307
00:22:03,116 --> 00:22:06,116
Yes, that's right. Just like before.

308
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:09,116
Good. Yes, that's how I got you in there.

309
00:22:09,116 --> 00:22:11,116
Yes! Hooray!

310
00:22:14,116 --> 00:22:16,116
My old dress!

311
00:22:16,116 --> 00:22:18,116
My favorite dress!

312
00:22:23,116 --> 00:22:26,116
My old dress! My favorite dress!

313
00:22:27,276 --> 00:22:30,276
Heidi was out of bounds and bound for joy.

314
00:22:30,276 --> 00:22:33,876
She cheered and sang and jumped around the field with Peter and the goats.

315
00:22:33,876 --> 00:22:35,876
Frankfurt was forgotten for her.

316
00:22:35,876 --> 00:22:40,876
The life in the mountains, which she loved so much, had begun again.

317
00:22:46,924 --> 00:22:53,924
Every day she went up to the meadow with Peter and the goats and even thought of
Clara more and more rarely.

318
00:22:53,924 --> 00:22:57,924
But one day a letter came from Frankfurt.

319
00:22:57,924 --> 00:23:06,924
Clara wrote to her and told her in her steep, clean writing by Miss Rottenmeier,
Mr. Sesemann and the canary bird Hansi.

320
00:23:06,924 --> 00:23:11,924
For Heidi this letter brought memories that she did not like at all.

321
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:15,924
For a moment she was very, very sad.

322
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:19,738
But then something happened that immediately distracted her again.

323
00:23:19,738 --> 00:23:23,738
But we want to tell you about that in our next story.

324
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:32,600
Heidi, Heidi, your world are the mountains.

325
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:40,600
Heidi, Heidi, because up here you are at home.

326
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:53,600
Heidi, Heidi, come home, find your happiness, come back again.

327
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,400
To be continued
