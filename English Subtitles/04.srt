1
00:01:20,186 --> 00:01:27,186
Heidi lived at the Almeuil for three days and every new day was as exciting for
her as the previous one.

2
00:01:27,186 --> 00:01:36,186
Every morning she stood up with the sun, greeted the birds as if they were her
very personal friends and then she waited impatiently for Peter.

3
00:01:44,058 --> 00:01:55,058
"Just look at this Heidi, she's even bringing in the goats. Open your eyes.
You're hopeless."

4
00:02:27,642 --> 00:02:30,202
There was once a goat in the sky.

5
00:02:36,602 --> 00:02:40,602
Oh, something like that. Now she has simply dissolved.

6
00:02:41,602 --> 00:02:43,602
Tell me, are you actually never hungry?

7
00:02:43,602 --> 00:02:45,602
I don't have time to eat.

8
00:02:46,602 --> 00:02:48,602
Me neither.

9
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:53,602
Oh, if you don't have time, then I'll eat for you.

10
00:02:53,602 --> 00:02:56,602
Don't worry about that. I can eat alone.

11
00:03:01,145 --> 00:03:03,145
But that's a nice flower.

12
00:03:03,145 --> 00:03:06,145
Snuggie, come here. It must taste very good.

13
00:03:10,145 --> 00:03:13,145
Do you think the flower tastes as good as it looks?

14
00:03:16,145 --> 00:03:18,145
What's going on now?

15
00:03:18,145 --> 00:03:19,077
Hold my hat!

16
00:03:35,385 --> 00:03:39,385
We have to see how we get out of here. It's too dangerous up here. Let's go.

17
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:42,385
But why? Because I think we want to eat something now.

18
00:03:42,385 --> 00:03:44,385
But why? Because I think we want to eat something now.

19
00:03:44,385 --> 00:03:46,021
But why? Because I think we want to eat something now.

20
00:03:59,513 --> 00:04:01,513
That's not a storm!

21
00:04:05,369 --> 00:04:08,369
- It's just a wind! - Not even then you'll get on my nerves!

22
00:05:34,617 --> 00:05:38,617
You'll get a nice kiss if you go on like this! Even the goats hide in front of
the rain!

23
00:05:38,617 --> 00:05:42,617
All right, if you mean it, I'll hide too, but I don't care!

24
00:05:42,617 --> 00:05:44,389
Let's see who's there first!

25
00:06:02,968 --> 00:06:09,968
- Hans! - It's okay, you don't have to be afraid, we're well-prepared here, and
he's on his way.

26
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:33,792
I'll tell you something. - What is it? - You know what? I'm hungry like a bear,
I could eat your whole forest.

27
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:40,792
- You're hungry? - Yes, and how? - How can you think of food now? - What a pity.

28
00:06:40,792 --> 00:06:44,792
Heidi would never have thought that her beloved mountains would have another
face.

29
00:06:44,792 --> 00:06:49,792
Not a friendly and lovely one, full of sun, flowers, scent and birds chirping,

30
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:52,792
but a cruel and dangerous one.

31
00:06:52,792 --> 00:06:54,792
A face that can make you afraid.

32
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,200
And that's it.

33
00:07:32,376 --> 00:07:35,376
You have to get out of here. It's all over.

34
00:07:35,376 --> 00:07:37,376
It can go into the mountains so fast.

35
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,376
You don't have to be afraid anymore.

36
00:07:41,376 --> 00:07:43,204
Do you really mean it?

37
00:07:47,896 --> 00:07:49,896
The sun is shining again.

38
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,080
If you only told me that, I wouldn't have believed it.

39
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:18,664
I don't.

40
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
A bird?

41
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Oh, there's a bird over there.

42
00:08:41,144 --> 00:08:45,144
Look at me. He's sick. Poor little bird.

43
00:08:47,144 --> 00:08:51,144
Maybe there's a nest up there and he fell out during the storm.

44
00:08:53,144 --> 00:08:55,144
You know what? I'll just put him back in.

45
00:08:55,144 --> 00:08:58,144
No, no, no. That's out of the question.

46
00:08:58,144 --> 00:08:59,144
Why not?

47
00:08:59,144 --> 00:09:03,144
Because there's something wrong with his wing and I have to take care of it.

48
00:09:03,144 --> 00:09:05,144
We'll give it to the grandfather.

49
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,144
He'll be grateful.

50
00:09:07,144 --> 00:09:08,144
Why not?

51
00:09:08,205 --> 00:09:12,205
He has enough with his goats. How can he take care of a bird?

52
00:09:12,205 --> 00:09:14,205
Then I'll breed him myself.

53
00:09:14,205 --> 00:09:16,205
He's already been bred.

54
00:09:16,205 --> 00:09:18,205
Then I'll take care of him and raise him.

55
00:09:19,205 --> 00:09:22,205
That's way too small. You'll never do that in life.

56
00:09:22,205 --> 00:09:24,205
And yet...

57
00:09:24,205 --> 00:09:25,205
Leave the bird here!

58
00:09:25,205 --> 00:09:27,205
I won't leave it!

59
00:09:29,205 --> 00:09:32,205
I'll prove to you that I can do it.

60
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:35,205
But Heidi...

61
00:09:35,205 --> 00:09:37,731
You can't go home alone!

62
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:11,079
It has to be something really exciting!

63
00:10:15,735 --> 00:10:17,735
Are you afraid of the thunderstorm?

64
00:10:22,007 --> 00:10:25,007
Didn't you know that you shouldn't touch young birds?

65
00:10:25,007 --> 00:10:28,007
Yes, but I think he broke the wing.

66
00:10:28,007 --> 00:10:31,007
It won't be easy to feed him.

67
00:10:31,007 --> 00:10:34,007
But why not? We have enough.

68
00:10:35,007 --> 00:10:39,007
Well, if you do something to him, then you can experience something.

69
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:44,007
He understood me. He certainly doesn't dare to approach him.

70
00:10:44,007 --> 00:10:46,007
How do you want to help him?

71
00:10:46,007 --> 00:10:49,007
I don't know yet, but somehow it has to be done.

72
00:10:49,007 --> 00:10:50,627
Tell him.

73
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:57,279
- He's much weaker than I thought. - Do you think we can't do anything with him?

74
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,279
- I don't know. - But it has to be done.

75
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,279
It's such a pretty, cute little bird.

76
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:09,279
- Something's definitely going to fall on you, grandfather. - Well, then get to
work.

77
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,279
- You have to look for insects, Heidi. Small mosquitoes, for example. - As many
as you want.

78
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,279
- The main thing is, we'll make it. - Oh, stop. Don't you need a nest?

79
00:11:27,511 --> 00:11:30,511
This is enough for the beginning. - A soup bowl?

80
00:11:30,511 --> 00:11:34,511
It doesn't matter to him. He doesn't know it's a soup bowl.

81
00:11:39,511 --> 00:11:42,511
Such a big annoyance from such a small bird.

82
00:11:47,351 --> 00:11:49,351
And one more.

83
00:11:53,655 --> 00:11:55,655
One more.

84
00:11:57,655 --> 00:12:00,655
And one more, so you can grow up.

85
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:02,655
Peter!

86
00:12:05,655 --> 00:12:09,655
Now I'm curious what kind of face he's making. He's going to burst into rage.

87
00:12:12,655 --> 00:12:14,655
Look, Snuggie, we have a new guest in the house.

88
00:12:15,655 --> 00:12:17,655
Snuggie! Still insulted?

89
00:12:19,164 --> 00:12:25,164
Wait, Peter! Look, he's taking his food! Grandfather thinks if he keeps going
like this, he'll grow up!

90
00:12:25,164 --> 00:12:29,164
I don't give a damn about your stupid bird!

91
00:12:29,164 --> 00:12:32,164
Then I don't give a damn about you either!

92
00:12:32,164 --> 00:12:36,164
What did he do to the bird? He didn't do anything to it!

93
00:12:36,164 --> 00:12:38,164
What is it?

94
00:12:38,164 --> 00:12:41,164
Nothing at all. Peter is just a little bit jealous.

95
00:12:41,164 --> 00:12:44,796
But he doesn't need that at all. I don't understand that at all.

96
00:12:44,796 --> 00:12:48,796
Come back, Peter. Don't act like a stupid boy and don't come here at once.

97
00:12:48,796 --> 00:12:52,796
But I don't like to come. I don't even think about it.

98
00:12:52,796 --> 00:12:57,796
First I'm happy and now it's this stupid bird. Suddenly I'm not good enough
anymore.

99
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:18,294
Peter, are the goats all right?

100
00:13:18,294 --> 00:13:21,294
Do you know anything about the little one from the meadow?

101
00:13:21,294 --> 00:13:22,294
Is she all right?

102
00:13:22,294 --> 00:13:24,294
She can be.

103
00:13:24,294 --> 00:13:29,294
Open your mouth, is something wrong with her?

104
00:13:29,294 --> 00:13:32,294
How should I know?

105
00:13:32,294 --> 00:13:34,294
Peter, do you want to play?

106
00:13:34,294 --> 00:13:36,294
Nobody talks to me.

107
00:13:36,294 --> 00:13:39,294
Give the old one something to eat.

108
00:13:40,294 --> 00:13:42,294
Is she pale?

109
00:13:42,294 --> 00:13:44,156
Wait, I'll play with you.

110
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:48,156
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. That doesn't sound good.

111
00:13:48,156 --> 00:13:51,156
Maybe we should take a look.

112
00:14:37,718 --> 00:14:39,718
That's good.

113
00:14:39,718 --> 00:14:42,718
I think it's hungry. It keeps closing its beak.

114
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:47,718
What do you think about having breakfast first?

115
00:14:47,718 --> 00:14:50,718
First I have to see if I can find some insects.

116
00:15:04,981 --> 00:15:06,981
I don't care.

117
00:15:08,981 --> 00:15:10,981
Do you want to see the sack?

118
00:15:13,981 --> 00:15:16,981
I'm not interested in what you've collected in your sack.

119
00:15:16,981 --> 00:15:18,981
I'll say it anyway. All insects.

120
00:15:18,981 --> 00:15:19,981
All insects?

121
00:15:19,981 --> 00:15:22,981
You don't believe how much you have to collect.

122
00:15:22,981 --> 00:15:23,981
Time-disappearance.

123
00:15:23,981 --> 00:15:24,981
That doesn't matter to me.

124
00:15:24,981 --> 00:15:26,981
The main thing is that he gets somehow full.

125
00:15:26,981 --> 00:15:28,981
He eats all the time.

126
00:15:28,981 --> 00:15:30,981
I think so. But I know a better way.

127
00:15:31,787 --> 00:15:35,787
Just let him fly. Then he can collect his own ants and eat whatever he wants.

128
00:15:36,787 --> 00:15:39,787
That could be good for you right now. So that you know it.

129
00:15:40,787 --> 00:15:42,787
You can leave it to me.

130
00:15:50,101 --> 00:15:54,101
Schnucki, now I'm going to run after him quickly, otherwise he'll get mad at you
too.

131
00:15:54,101 --> 00:15:57,101
Now run! Come on, jump quickly!

132
00:16:00,101 --> 00:16:03,101
Heidi couldn't understand what was going on with Peter.

133
00:16:03,101 --> 00:16:05,101
He was always so nice.

134
00:16:05,101 --> 00:16:09,101
He hadn't even asked her once if she wanted to accompany him today.

135
00:16:10,101 --> 00:16:13,101
But I don't have any time right now anyway.

136
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:20,109
Are you even more hungry?

137
00:16:20,109 --> 00:16:23,109
No, I don't understand what you're trying to say.

138
00:16:23,109 --> 00:16:26,109
Do you want grasshoppers today?

139
00:16:26,109 --> 00:16:29,109
Joseph! Peep, grasshoppers!

140
00:17:02,677 --> 00:17:04,677
This weird thing seems to taste good.

141
00:17:19,509 --> 00:17:21,509
I'm sorry, but we have a bird.

142
00:17:32,053 --> 00:17:34,053
Now you have eaten it away.

143
00:17:38,805 --> 00:17:40,805
Does it even taste good?

144
00:17:52,213 --> 00:17:54,213
She will have tasted it.

145
00:17:54,213 --> 00:17:56,213
You think so?

146
00:17:56,213 --> 00:17:58,213
Why shouldn't he have an appetite for snails?

147
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:02,213
Maybe he also has an appetite for birds.

148
00:18:02,213 --> 00:18:04,213
Joseph, here!

149
00:18:14,292 --> 00:18:20,292
It doesn't come into question at all. That's what you thought.

150
00:18:22,292 --> 00:18:25,292
Grandfather, you absolutely have to build a cage.

151
00:18:25,292 --> 00:18:30,292
I assume you want your bird to have a cage.

152
00:18:30,292 --> 00:18:33,292
Exactly. Otherwise Joseph will eat him.

153
00:18:33,292 --> 00:18:34,292
Joseph?

154
00:18:34,292 --> 00:18:36,292
At least he ate a snail.

155
00:18:36,292 --> 00:18:38,292
Now you're scared.

156
00:18:40,292 --> 00:18:43,292
Don't worry about it.

157
00:19:02,196 --> 00:19:04,196
Don't worry. I'll take care of you.

158
00:19:05,196 --> 00:19:07,196
He won't come to you, Peep-Matz.

159
00:19:08,196 --> 00:19:11,196
What do you think? How do you feel in your new house?

160
00:19:11,196 --> 00:19:12,196
Take good care of yourself.

161
00:19:12,196 --> 00:19:15,196
When the dog comes, just knock over the fence.

162
00:21:05,747 --> 00:21:07,747
You're still alive?

163
00:21:20,755 --> 00:21:23,755
Hm, there's your hat on the ladder.

164
00:21:23,755 --> 00:21:27,755
I think you fell off the ladder all by yourself.

165
00:21:30,755 --> 00:21:32,755
Joseph didn't want to.

166
00:21:36,883 --> 00:21:38,883
Joseph!

167
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,883
Now he's asleep again.

168
00:21:46,883 --> 00:21:49,883
I know it now, Joseph. You wanted to save him.

169
00:21:49,883 --> 00:21:51,883
I thought you wanted to eat him.

170
00:21:51,883 --> 00:21:54,883
Joseph, please don't be mean to me.

171
00:21:56,883 --> 00:21:59,883
You're a sweet dog, Joseph.

172
00:21:59,883 --> 00:22:02,883
Even though you're so big that you have to be afraid of you.

173
00:22:02,883 --> 00:22:05,883
Why are you leaving now?

174
00:22:07,635 --> 00:22:11,635
It's a pity, but thank you very much

175
00:22:11,635 --> 00:22:18,635
It took a long time, but finally Heidi understood how kind and good-natured this
Bernadina was

176
00:22:18,635 --> 00:22:23,635
From this moment on, Joseph was her good friend, like her grandfather and like
Peter

177
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:28,635
Even though Peter has become a bit strange in his opinion lately

178
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:55,303
Heidi didn't know yet how fast her little bird would grow

179
00:22:55,303 --> 00:23:00,303
She didn't have the slightest idea how and when she could mate with Peter

180
00:23:00,303 --> 00:23:04,303
All she knew was that she was happy here on the Alp

181
00:23:04,303 --> 00:23:10,303
That she liked the goats, the meadows, the mountains, all her new friends very,
very much

182
00:23:10,303 --> 00:23:13,803
But sometimes very unexpected things happen

183
00:23:13,803 --> 00:23:16,303
Beautiful and less beautiful

184
00:23:16,303 --> 00:23:20,297
But how Heidi is doing up there on the Alp

185
00:23:20,297 --> 00:23:25,077
we want to tell you the next time in a new story
