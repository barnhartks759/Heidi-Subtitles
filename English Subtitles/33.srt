Find your happiness

23
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,430
Come back home

24
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,430

Ms. Rottenmeier?

Yes!

42
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,430
Please, what is it, Sebastian?

43
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,730
The ghost is back.

44
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,530
How many times do I have to say that I don't like this nonsense?

45
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,730
But it's true. I saw him myself.

46
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,630
It's a white ghost.

47
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,330
You must have only dreamed.

48
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,130
That can't be true at all, because we haven't slept yet.

49
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:22,830
Oh, you don't want to say that he exists?

50
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,530
Of course. I saw him with my own eyes.

51
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:30,730
Oh, then get garlic, chamber hunter, ghost summoner, whatever you need to get
rid of him.

52
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:34,330
Oh, why? I was just missing that.

53
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,530
FrÃ¤ulein Rottenmeier, what happened?

54
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,930
Wait a minute!

55
00:02:37,978 --> 00:02:39,978
I hope he's not with her.

56
00:02:39,978 --> 00:02:41,978
In which direction did he disappear?

57
00:02:41,978 --> 00:02:42,978
I don't know.

58
00:02:42,978 --> 00:02:43,978
Come with me.

59
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,050
Why aren't you sleeping, Mrs. Clara?

60
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,050
Someone was screaming in the hallway.

61
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,050
You're only dreaming.

62
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,050
I didn't hear anything.

63
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,050
I was awake. I heard it exactly.

64
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,050
Well, well.

65
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,050
You'll find out at some point.

66
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,050
We have a ghost.

67
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,050
When did the guest come?

68
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,050
I didn't mean guest. I said ghost.

69
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,050
Ghost!

70
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:16,050
Sebastian claims he was ghosting on the stairs.

71
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,050
I don't think there are ghosts anymore.

72
00:03:19,235 --> 00:03:23,235
Ms. Clara, calm down, please. No excitement.

73
00:03:23,235 --> 00:03:25,235
It's just supposed to be a very small ghost.

74
00:03:25,235 --> 00:03:28,235
I don't care how big it is, I think it's terrible.

75
00:03:28,235 --> 00:03:32,235
I'm convinced that Sebastian was mistaken. He must have been dreaming.

76
00:03:32,235 --> 00:03:34,235
Yes, believe me.

77
00:03:34,235 --> 00:03:36,235
And if he wasn't mistaken?

78
00:03:36,235 --> 00:03:39,235
I'm so scared. Please write to my father.

79
00:03:39,235 --> 00:03:41,235
Yes, of course.

81
00:03:49,827 --> 00:03:51,827
Good afternoon, Sebastian.

82
00:03:51,827 --> 00:03:52,827
Welcome home.

83
00:03:52,827 --> 00:03:53,827
Thank you.

84
00:03:54,827 --> 00:03:55,827
Clara!

85
00:03:56,827 --> 00:03:58,827
Oh, Papa! Good afternoon!

86
00:04:00,827 --> 00:04:04,827
Let me look at you, my child. You have become much prettier since the last time.

87
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:06,827
How do you do that?

88
00:04:06,827 --> 00:04:09,827
You always say that when you come home, Papa.

89
00:04:09,827 --> 00:04:12,827
I think I have to say thank you to the ghost. He brought you here.

90
00:04:14,827 --> 00:04:16,827
Hello, Heidi. Well, little one?

91
00:04:16,827 --> 00:04:18,777
Good afternoon, Mr. Sesemann.

92
00:04:18,777 --> 00:04:21,777
Where did your red becky go? You're so pale.

93
00:04:21,777 --> 00:04:23,777
Have you grown up?

94
00:04:23,777 --> 00:04:25,777
I think so.

95
00:04:25,777 --> 00:04:27,777
You're going to be a lady.

96
00:04:27,777 --> 00:04:29,777
Excuse me, sir.

97
00:04:29,777 --> 00:04:30,777
Yes, I'm coming.

98
00:04:30,777 --> 00:04:32,777
I hope you weren't afraid.

99
00:04:32,777 --> 00:04:34,777
We'll show it to the ghost.

100
00:04:35,777 --> 00:04:36,777
Were you afraid?

101
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,777
Yes, but not anymore.

102
00:04:40,777 --> 00:04:42,777
Now he can't hurt us anymore.

103
00:04:44,361 --> 00:04:47,361
He was standing on the stairs and I swear to you, it was a ghost.

104
00:04:47,361 --> 00:04:50,361
At first he was just so small and then suddenly he was so huge.

105
00:04:50,361 --> 00:04:53,361
I'm really not very fearful, but that was too much.

106
00:04:53,361 --> 00:04:55,361
He was white and he was floating.

107
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:58,361
Maybe it's a young ghost because he didn't even crawl.

108
00:04:58,361 --> 00:05:00,361
Very strange.

109
00:05:00,361 --> 00:05:04,361
Johan, please fasten the horses and get Mr. Geheimrat off.

110
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:08,361
We will lure this supposed ghost out tonight, but I would like to have our
doctor.

111
00:05:14,115 --> 00:05:17,115
Come in, please.

112
00:05:17,115 --> 00:05:18,115
Good day.

113
00:05:18,115 --> 00:05:20,115
Well, little lady, how are you?

114
00:05:20,115 --> 00:05:21,115
Did the flu get over well?

115
00:05:21,115 --> 00:05:25,115
The flu does, but I'm afraid it hasn't overcome our house spirit yet.

116
00:05:25,115 --> 00:05:27,115
Dad's right.

117
00:05:27,115 --> 00:05:28,115
And you?

118
00:05:28,115 --> 00:05:29,115
Fear too?

119
00:05:29,115 --> 00:05:30,115
Good day.

120
00:05:30,115 --> 00:05:32,115
I don't like you at all, child.

121
00:05:32,115 --> 00:05:34,115
Why are you so pale?

122
00:05:34,115 --> 00:05:37,115
Heidi hasn't eaten anything for two days now.

123
00:05:37,145 --> 00:05:38,545
That must have a reason.

124
00:05:38,545 --> 00:05:41,945
After we have captured the ghost, we want to examine you in detail.

125
00:05:41,945 --> 00:05:44,945
No, they don't need that. I'm very healthy.

126
00:05:48,245 --> 00:05:51,245
Maybe only one of the servants is allowed to make a joke.

127
00:05:52,645 --> 00:05:54,345
Or it's an intruder.

128
00:05:55,545 --> 00:05:56,945
Chess the king.

129
00:05:59,545 --> 00:06:00,945
Now it will show itself.

130
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,040
It will show itself.

131
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,040
It will show itself.

It's so beautiful outside!

134
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:44,668
Who are you, grandfather?

135
00:06:44,984 --> 00:06:46,984
Where are you?

136
00:07:14,984 --> 00:07:41,804
It's so cold.

137
00:07:41,804 --> 00:07:43,804
Why are my feet so cold?

138
00:07:46,804 --> 00:07:48,804
Hello? Is anybody there?

139
00:08:11,804 --> 00:08:13,804
Hello?

140
00:08:14,572 --> 00:08:17,032
Heidi, what are you doing there in the cold?

141
00:08:17,112 --> 00:08:19,952
Calm down, Mr. Sesemann. Leave it to me, please.

142
00:08:23,572 --> 00:08:25,952
You don't have to be afraid. Come on.

143
00:08:26,032 --> 00:08:27,992
We're going to your room now.

144
00:08:30,952 --> 00:08:31,952
Come on.

145
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:38,948
Don't be afraid.

146
00:08:38,948 --> 00:08:40,948
Here, please.

147
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:02,060
I should talk to her alone for a few minutes.

148
00:09:13,525 --> 00:09:19,845
Well, have you calmed down a bit? Can't you talk to me yet?

149
00:09:19,845 --> 00:09:25,145
I definitely didn't want to run away again. Suddenly I stood in front of the

150
00:09:25,145 --> 00:09:30,185
house door. So that's how it was. Then you must have dreamed.

151
00:09:30,185 --> 00:09:36,245
Yes, I always dream when I sleep. Can you still remember what you

152
00:09:36,245 --> 00:09:38,955
dreamed? Yes, of course I can.

153
00:09:38,955 --> 00:09:41,555
I always dream the same dream every night.

154
00:09:41,555 --> 00:09:47,055
My roosters called for me and I went out of the hut to see them.

155
00:09:47,055 --> 00:09:50,955
But every time I wake up, I'm still here in Frankfurt.

156
00:09:50,955 --> 00:09:52,855
So?

157
00:09:52,855 --> 00:09:59,755
In Frankfurt. The stars have fluttered so beautifully and the moon is shining.

158
00:09:59,755 --> 00:10:03,455
Does something hurt you, Heidi? The head or the belly?

159
00:10:03,455 --> 00:10:07,655
No, but there's something in my throat. I always have to cry.

160
00:10:07,655 --> 00:10:09,419
Really?

161
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:12,419
If you have that feeling, will you cry then?

162
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:16,419
No, Mrs. Rottenmeier said I can't cry so that Clara doesn't get upset.

163
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:20,419
That's how it is. Did Mrs. Rottenmeier ask you to do that?

164
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:25,419
Yes, she forbade me to cry. And I'm not allowed to talk to Clara about the
mountains.

165
00:10:25,419 --> 00:10:29,419
I assume you like to talk about the mountains.

166
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:33,419
Tell me, do you actually like being here with us in Frankfurt?

167
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:35,419
Yes.

168
00:10:35,419 --> 00:10:39,115
Child, where does your grandfather live?

169
00:10:39,115 --> 00:10:41,755
At home in the Alps.

170
00:10:41,755 --> 00:10:44,155
Don't you want to go to him?

171
00:10:44,155 --> 00:10:50,155
Yes, but I can't. I have to stay here because of Clara.

172
00:10:58,997 --> 00:11:01,997
That's the way it is. Just stay with me.

173
00:11:01,997 --> 00:11:03,997
You are a lovely thing.

174
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,997
Try to fall asleep, Heidi.

175
00:11:20,373 --> 00:11:22,373
The poor little one, that can't be true.

176
00:11:22,373 --> 00:11:25,373
Yes, I'm very sorry to have to say that.

177
00:11:25,373 --> 00:11:27,373
Heidi doesn't know how to behave at home anymore.

178
00:11:27,373 --> 00:11:29,373
Yes, didn't Mrs. Rottenmeier notice that?

179
00:11:29,373 --> 00:11:30,373
No.

180
00:11:30,373 --> 00:11:33,373
Oh, yes, of course, I have to make the accusations.

181
00:11:33,373 --> 00:11:35,373
I should have noticed it right away.

182
00:11:35,373 --> 00:11:38,373
She couldn't stand the child from the beginning.

183
00:11:38,373 --> 00:11:41,373
I should have taken care of myself. But what should I do?

184
00:11:41,373 --> 00:11:43,373
Even accusations have no meaning.

185
00:11:43,373 --> 00:11:45,373
This is lost time.

186
00:11:45,373 --> 00:11:48,373
We should rather think about how we can help Heidi.

187
00:11:48,373 --> 00:11:50,373
She has to leave this place.

188
00:11:50,795 --> 00:11:52,795
Is that the only way?

189
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,795
How am I supposed to teach Clara how to do that?

190
00:11:55,795 --> 00:11:56,795
What a disaster!

191
00:11:56,795 --> 00:11:57,795
Oh, come on.

192
00:11:58,795 --> 00:12:00,795
We have to think about the little one first.

193
00:12:00,795 --> 00:12:01,795
She's in worse shape at the moment.

194
00:12:01,795 --> 00:12:02,795
Not least because of us.

195
00:12:02,795 --> 00:12:04,795
Unfortunately, Heidi has to go to the mountains.

196
00:12:04,795 --> 00:12:08,795
So far, no one has been able to invent any medication against home pain.

197
00:12:12,795 --> 00:12:15,795
Just remember the little, lively child that came here.

198
00:12:15,795 --> 00:12:19,795
And then take a closer look at what Heidi looks like today.

199
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:27,020
Yes, you're right. I'm an old fool.

200
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:32,240
Yes, it's me. Can I bother you so late?

201
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,880
But of course. Come in.

202
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,200
Thank you. Please prepare everything for the departure immediately.

203
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,980
What? You're driving again? The poor Clara.

204
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:46,440
Heidi is leaving. I found out that you are the ghost.

205
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:50,724
Oh, Heidi! Uh, Adelheid. I thought of that right away.

206
00:12:50,724 --> 00:12:51,724
Yes, Heidi.

207
00:12:51,724 --> 00:12:54,724
I'm used to it, but this time it's the summit.

208
00:12:54,724 --> 00:12:57,724
Wait a minute. Heidi didn't do it on purpose.

209
00:12:57,724 --> 00:12:59,724
But of course!

210
00:12:59,724 --> 00:13:04,724
But no, didn't you actually notice that Heidi is sick from home sickness? She's
changing in her sleep.

211
00:13:04,724 --> 00:13:08,724
Uh ... I only did it for Clara.

212
00:13:08,724 --> 00:13:10,724
What does that mean?

213
00:13:10,724 --> 00:13:12,724
I really had no other choice.

214
00:13:12,724 --> 00:13:14,436
Mrs. Clara likes Heidi.

215
00:13:14,436 --> 00:13:19,236
She really wanted this child to stay here, but she doesn't look like this
creature.

216
00:13:19,236 --> 00:13:21,036
What do you mean, she doesn't look like this?

217
00:13:21,036 --> 00:13:24,336
I forbade her to mention these mountains to Mrs. Clara.

218
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:29,336
But instead of being grateful, she threatens to travel away with it all the
time.

219
00:13:29,336 --> 00:13:33,236
In the end, she went so far that she cried uncontrollably.

220
00:13:33,236 --> 00:13:35,236
And I forbade her to love Clara.

221
00:13:35,236 --> 00:13:37,636
What did you say?

222
00:13:37,636 --> 00:13:41,336
You seem to have tormented this poor little thing terribly.

223
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,380
I only meant well with your daughter.

224
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,380
Then you must have forgotten that I love Heidi like a daughter.

225
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,380
Oh, this thing!

226
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:55,380
I think I've just met her.

227
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:17,086
Poor little Heidi.

228
00:14:17,086 --> 00:14:20,086
What did you do with it, little one?

229
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,166
Good morning.

230
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,166
How are you today?

231
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:37,166
Heidi, I want to tell you something and I'm sure you'll be very, very happy
about it.

232
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:40,166
You're going home, to the mountains.

233
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:41,166
To the mountains?

234
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:44,166
Yes, home to your grandfather.

235
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:48,166
Home to my grandfather, to my mountains?

236
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:53,166
Yes, Heidi. You can go home right after breakfast.

237
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:58,166
I can go home! I can go home!

238
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,166
I can go home! I can!

239
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:05,166
I can't.

240
00:15:06,215 --> 00:15:09,215
Why? Don't you want more at once?

241
00:15:09,215 --> 00:15:11,215
Oh, yes. I can't go because of Clara.

242
00:15:11,215 --> 00:15:13,215
When I drive, she has to be alone again.

243
00:15:13,215 --> 00:15:16,215
Heidi, are you afraid to tell Clara?

244
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:19,215
Not that. I'm afraid that she'll cry.

245
00:15:19,215 --> 00:15:20,215
I see.

246
00:15:20,215 --> 00:15:22,215
It's not nice when you always have to cry.

247
00:15:22,215 --> 00:15:25,215
I don't want Clara to be like me.

248
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:28,215
But Heidi, Clara will never be alone again.

249
00:15:28,215 --> 00:15:31,215
I promise you that. Believe me.

250
00:15:33,863 --> 00:15:36,863
You know, Heidi, I'll stay with Clara.

251
00:15:36,863 --> 00:15:39,863
I don't know yet how, but I'm still thinking about it.

252
00:15:39,863 --> 00:15:41,863
With swearing?

253
00:15:41,863 --> 00:15:45,863
Yes, with swearing. What I once promised, I also keep.

254
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:48,863
But Heidi, do I look like I would lie to a little friend?

255
00:15:48,863 --> 00:15:51,863
Clara and I, we'll stay together from today.

256
00:15:51,863 --> 00:15:55,863
That's nice. But if...

257
00:15:55,863 --> 00:15:59,863
Don't worry. You can leave in peace.

258
00:15:59,863 --> 00:16:02,863
Yes.

259
00:16:02,863 --> 00:16:04,263
No, no!

260
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:07,263
No, no, no! I don't want Heidi to go away!

261
00:16:07,263 --> 00:16:09,263
Clara, calm down.

262
00:16:09,263 --> 00:16:13,263
No, Papa, I don't want to calm down! I don't want it! Why?

263
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:16,263
Because your Heidi has a disease.

264
00:16:16,263 --> 00:16:19,263
There's no medicine for you. Heidi has a home-ache.

265
00:16:19,263 --> 00:16:21,263
A big home-ache, even.

266
00:16:24,263 --> 00:16:26,263
Oh, no!

267
00:16:28,263 --> 00:16:30,263
It can't be any other way.

268
00:16:30,263 --> 00:16:34,077
Does that mean I'll never see her again from now on?

269
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:36,877
If she's better, she'll come to visit us.

270
00:16:36,877 --> 00:16:39,917
Believe me, for Heidi it's the best, yes?

271
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:42,717
She never really liked it here in Frankfurt.

272
00:16:42,717 --> 00:16:46,437
When Grandmother was here, she liked it. It was nice there, too.

273
00:16:46,437 --> 00:16:50,037
Calm down. Heidi grew up in the mountains.

274
00:16:50,037 --> 00:16:53,037
You can't just lock her up in the city.

275
00:16:55,623 --> 00:16:59,623
I'm sorry, too. Heidi has grown very fond of me.

276
00:16:59,623 --> 00:17:05,623
But the Secret Service talked to me last night and said that she would get very
sick if she stayed here any longer.

277
00:17:05,623 --> 00:17:09,623
Now we can prevent that.

278
00:17:09,623 --> 00:17:15,623
You know what, Dad? I don't think Heidi will ever come here again. But I will go
visit her.

279
00:17:15,623 --> 00:17:17,623
Clara, will that work?

280
00:17:17,623 --> 00:17:22,141
Of course it will work! We also went on an excursion with Grandmother once.

281
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:26,041
We picked flowers and caught butterflies and went on a boat trip.

282
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:30,041
And a few days later, Heidi gave me a thousand butterflies.

283
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:33,041
A thousand at once? Clara...

284
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:37,041
This Heidi, I think she's really done for.

285
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,041
She says they're also in the mountains.

286
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:42,541
Yes, they're also in the mountains.

287
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:46,841
And that's exactly where you'll see her fly one day when we visit Heidi
together.

288
00:17:46,841 --> 00:17:48,341
With swearing, Papa?

289
00:17:48,341 --> 00:17:50,041
Yes, with swearing.

290
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,041
That seems to be common here now.

291
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,837
Where did you get that from?

292
00:17:53,837 --> 00:17:56,637
From my grandmother, of course.

293
00:17:56,637 --> 00:17:59,337
You? Papa?

294
00:17:59,337 --> 00:18:05,137
Will you bring me, when you have time later, Heidi's travel basket in my room?

295
00:18:05,137 --> 00:18:08,637
I would like to give her a few things that she wants.

296
00:18:08,637 --> 00:18:10,537
Yes, of course.

297
00:18:10,537 --> 00:18:14,737
A triller pipe for Peter, tobacco for grandfather,

298
00:18:14,737 --> 00:18:18,537
and white rolls for Peter's grandmother.

299
00:18:18,537 --> 00:18:20,637
I'll get you everything.

300
00:18:20,806 --> 00:18:26,806
Oh, it's bad. I know it's hard to do.

301
00:18:32,806 --> 00:18:36,806
I have to regret it again, but Mrs. Diete will not get a vacation.

302
00:18:37,806 --> 00:18:41,806
Aha, then you have to accompany her to the train and deliver it to her
grandfather.

303
00:18:41,806 --> 00:18:43,806
I should go?

304
00:18:43,806 --> 00:18:45,806
Yes, you, so finish your journey.

305
00:18:45,806 --> 00:18:47,806
Yes, very much.

306
00:18:50,806 --> 00:18:52,806
See you later.

307
00:18:58,806 --> 00:19:00,806
Come in!

308
00:19:01,806 --> 00:19:03,806
Clara!

309
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,240
Thank God you came.

310
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,240
I know how much you're happy.

311
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,240
Aren't you angry with me?

312
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,240
You should be angry with me.

313
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,240
I knew all along that you wanted to go home.

314
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,240
And I tried to stop you. That was mean of me.

315
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,240
Clara.

316
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,240
I packed a few things for you that you might need.

317
00:19:31,696 --> 00:19:35,096
Oh, there are the white rolls for the grandmother in there.

318
00:19:35,096 --> 00:19:37,096
And a pipe for Peter.

319
00:19:37,096 --> 00:19:40,096
And tobacco for the grandfather.

320
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,896
That's nice of you, thank you.

321
00:19:41,896 --> 00:19:44,696
Sebastian takes even more with him, I thought everything would be too heavy.

322
00:19:44,696 --> 00:19:46,396
And what pretty handkerchiefs.

323
00:19:46,396 --> 00:19:48,096
And what is that for a box?

324
00:19:48,096 --> 00:19:50,096
But that's nicely painted.

325
00:19:52,096 --> 00:19:55,096
Oh, a sewing box.

326
00:19:55,096 --> 00:19:58,096
That's almost too much to sew with.

327
00:19:58,896 --> 00:20:00,496
What is that?

328
00:20:00,518 --> 00:20:04,518
You look wonderful. And how it fits your dress.

329
00:20:08,518 --> 00:20:12,518
Oh, I see. Your favorite hat. But it's really too old now.

330
00:20:12,518 --> 00:20:14,518
You think, Clara?

331
00:20:14,518 --> 00:20:18,518
If you can't get rid of it, then pack it in the suitcase and take it with you.

332
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:20,518
Yes, I'll do that.

333
00:20:22,518 --> 00:20:25,518
Goodbye, Clara, and thank you very, very much.

334
00:20:25,518 --> 00:20:27,366
You have to go now.

335
00:20:27,366 --> 00:20:30,866
Take good care of yourself, and greet the others, and don't forget me.

336
00:20:32,866 --> 00:20:36,366
You know what, Clara? I'd like to take you with me.

337
00:20:36,366 --> 00:20:39,866
You don't need that at all. I'll be there at some point.

338
00:20:39,866 --> 00:20:42,366
Whether you want it or not, you won't get rid of me so quickly.

339
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,866
What is it? Don't you want me to come?

340
00:20:44,866 --> 00:20:45,866
But, Clara...

341
00:20:45,866 --> 00:20:50,366
Like you, I must have looked like Miss Rottenmeier when she saw the ghost.

342
00:20:50,366 --> 00:20:51,366
Now, believe me.

343
00:20:51,366 --> 00:20:52,366
Oh, Clara!

344
00:20:53,866 --> 00:20:55,366
When are you coming?

345
00:20:55,366 --> 00:20:56,182
Soon.

346
00:20:56,182 --> 00:20:58,782
As soon as Mr. Secretary allows it. In the spring.

347
00:20:59,582 --> 00:21:01,982
Clara, live well, Heidi.

348
00:21:18,969 --> 00:21:20,969
Take good care of yourself, Heidi.

349
00:21:20,969 --> 00:21:22,969
Yes.

350
00:21:22,969 --> 00:21:24,969
And don't lose him.

351
00:21:24,969 --> 00:21:26,969
Give him to your grandfather, yes?

352
00:21:26,969 --> 00:21:28,969
And tell him I would be happy to hear an answer.

353
00:21:28,969 --> 00:21:30,969
Yes.

354
00:21:32,969 --> 00:21:34,969
Oh, Mr. Sesemann,

355
00:21:34,969 --> 00:21:36,969
please tell the secret police a nice greeting from me.

356
00:21:36,969 --> 00:21:38,969
With pleasure.

357
00:21:38,969 --> 00:21:40,969
Johann, it's time for you.

358
00:21:40,969 --> 00:21:42,969
Goodbye, Clara.

359
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:44,969
And come back for real, yes?

360
00:21:44,969 --> 00:21:46,969
Yes, of course.

361
00:21:46,969 --> 00:21:48,969
Clara.

362
00:21:49,721 --> 00:21:51,721
Heidi?

363
00:21:52,261 --> 00:21:54,261
See you later!

364
00:21:54,261 --> 00:21:56,261
I'll come to visit you, Heidi!

365
00:21:56,261 --> 00:21:58,261
Live well!

366
00:21:58,261 --> 00:22:00,261
See you later!

367
00:22:00,261 --> 00:22:02,261
Live well, Clara!

368
00:22:22,261 --> 00:22:24,261
He mustn't get lost, kid!

369
00:22:49,177 --> 00:22:53,177
The farewell from Frankfurt was not difficult for Heidi.

370
00:22:53,177 --> 00:22:56,177
The whistling of the locomotive sounded like music to her.

371
00:22:56,177 --> 00:22:59,177
Only when she thought of Clara, she became sad for a moment.

372
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:04,177
But the unending joy of being at home immediately drove away all the gloomy
thoughts.

373
00:23:04,177 --> 00:23:10,177
Again and again she tried to imagine with her eyes closed in which light she
would see the mountains

374
00:23:10,177 --> 00:23:15,177
and whether she would storm the Alps at sunrise or sunset.

375
00:23:15,391 --> 00:23:19,891
Heidi could hardly wait to finally get home.

376
00:23:19,891 --> 00:23:24,891
But we want to tell you about that in our next story.

377
00:23:25,573 --> 00:23:35,573
Heide, Heide, your world are the mountains.

378
00:23:35,573 --> 00:23:43,573
Heide, Heide, because up here you are at home.

379
00:23:43,573 --> 00:23:51,573
Heide, Heide, come home, find your happiness,

380
00:23:51,573 --> 00:23:56,573
come back again.
