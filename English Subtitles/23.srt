1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,090
HALLELUJAH

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:13,090
HALLELUJAH

3
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:20,090
HALLELUJAH

4
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:25,090
HALLELUJAH

5
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,530
The mountains are the world

6
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:32,530
Heidi, Heidi

7
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:36,530
Because up here you are at home

8
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:40,530
Dark fir trees

9
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,530
Green meadows in the sunshine

10
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:48,530
Heidi, Heidi

11
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,490
Do you need to be...

12
00:01:12,026 --> 00:01:14,026
Find your happiness

13
00:01:14,026 --> 00:01:19,026
Come back again

14
00:01:20,218 --> 00:01:28,218
Do you remember? Heidi had secretly sneaked away to look at the mountains from a
high church tower.

15
00:01:28,218 --> 00:01:34,218
But all she saw were houses, stones and, far behind, the Main.

16
00:01:34,218 --> 00:01:42,218
She had climbed up the stairs to the observation deck with so much hope, but on
the way down she was sad and disappointed.

17
00:01:42,218 --> 00:01:49,218
The tower guard tried to encourage her, but what did he know about Heimweh?

18
00:01:50,218 --> 00:01:56,218
Here's what he told us.

19
00:01:56,538 --> 00:01:59,538
I'm tired. I can't walk anymore.

20
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:23,242
Hush, be quiet.

21
00:02:26,242 --> 00:02:28,242
Little kitten.

22
00:02:30,242 --> 00:02:32,242
Well, do you like the kittens?

23
00:02:32,242 --> 00:02:34,242
I once had a dog and two goats.

24
00:02:34,242 --> 00:02:36,242
Josef, Schweli and Berli.

25
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:40,242
Why don't you take one?

26
00:02:42,242 --> 00:02:44,242
May I keep a kitten?

27
00:02:44,242 --> 00:02:45,242
Of course.

28
00:02:46,242 --> 00:02:48,242
Thank you, I'll pick one, okay?

29
00:02:51,242 --> 00:02:52,090
You're welcome.

30
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,090
You go out nicely.

31
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,090
Off with you.

32
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,090
Of course she doesn't want to give them away.

33
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,090
Cats.

34
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,090
Does it matter which one I take?

35
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:07,090
Or is there one that you would like to keep for yourself?

36
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,090
I'll eat it right away.

37
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:11,090
No, I'll take the dark one.

38
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,090
Or the white one.

39
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,026
Or...

40
00:03:15,026 --> 00:03:17,026
...this one.

41
00:03:17,026 --> 00:03:19,026
From here you can have them all.

42
00:03:19,026 --> 00:03:22,026
I have to see how I'm going to get rid of them anyway.

43
00:03:24,026 --> 00:03:26,026
Do you know the house of Sesemanns?

44
00:03:26,026 --> 00:03:28,026
Everyone in town knows the house.

45
00:03:28,026 --> 00:03:30,026
Then bring the cats there.

46
00:03:30,026 --> 00:03:32,026
The house is so big, everyone fits in there.

47
00:03:33,026 --> 00:03:34,026
Stop!

48
00:03:35,026 --> 00:03:37,026
Children and little animals.

49
00:03:38,604 --> 00:03:42,604
Little white kittens have white tits.

50
00:03:42,604 --> 00:03:44,604
My kitten is so cute.

51
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:52,764
Let's go on.

52
00:04:08,076 --> 00:04:11,076
This is the house of Sesemanns. We have finally arrived.

53
00:04:11,076 --> 00:04:14,076
Goodbye! Don't forget the money!

54
00:04:14,076 --> 00:04:16,076
No, but wait a moment!

55
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,300
The whole house is in bright excitement. Quick!

56
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,300
Hey, open the door!

57
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,300
I should climb up to the church tower.

58
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,300
Oh dear heaven, if you tell the old scarecrow that I brought you up to the idea,
I will be relieved.

59
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,300
That fits, scarecrow fits.

60
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,300
For God's sake, don't call her that.

61
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,300
Is that a cat or am I dreaming?

62
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:48,300
I completely forgot. What am I doing now? How do I hide the cat in front of Mrs.
Rottenmeier?

63
00:04:53,036 --> 00:04:56,036
Come in.

64
00:04:56,036 --> 00:04:58,036
Good evening.

65
00:04:58,036 --> 00:05:00,036
Oh, Heidi.

66
00:05:00,036 --> 00:05:03,036
I want to apologize, I'm late.

67
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:06,036
I know that by myself that you're late.

68
00:05:06,036 --> 00:05:10,036
I didn't have to tell you that leaving the house is a bad habit

69
00:05:10,036 --> 00:05:12,036
and no one to tell you anything about it.

70
00:05:12,036 --> 00:05:17,036
And if you go out in the future, I would like to ask you to be back on time for
the meals.

71
00:05:17,036 --> 00:05:20,036
I don't want to upset my nerves today.

72
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:22,754
It would make no sense.

73
00:05:22,754 --> 00:05:24,754
You always notice that you don't...

74
00:05:24,754 --> 00:05:26,754
Oh!

75
00:05:26,754 --> 00:05:28,754
Adelheid,

76
00:05:28,754 --> 00:05:30,754
if you intend to make fun of me,

77
00:05:30,754 --> 00:05:32,754
then do it upstairs in your room.

78
00:05:32,754 --> 00:05:34,754
I don't want to. I mean, I can't.

79
00:05:34,754 --> 00:05:36,754
I...

80
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:38,754
There it is again.

81
00:05:38,754 --> 00:05:40,754
Adelheid, go to your room.

82
00:05:40,754 --> 00:05:42,754
But why?

83
00:05:42,754 --> 00:05:44,754
Now I've had enough.

84
00:05:44,754 --> 00:05:46,754
I'm at the end of my nerve power.

85
00:05:46,754 --> 00:05:48,754
Disappear

86
00:05:48,754 --> 00:05:49,922
and off to bed!

87
00:05:49,922 --> 00:05:51,022
...without dinner!

88
00:05:51,022 --> 00:05:53,722
I'm definitely not following her, Miss Rottenmeier.

89
00:05:53,722 --> 00:05:55,422
It's a real cat.

90
00:05:57,922 --> 00:05:59,822
She's very small and cute.

91
00:05:59,822 --> 00:06:00,522
Help!

92
00:06:01,122 --> 00:06:02,022
Tinette!

93
00:06:02,322 --> 00:06:03,522
Tinette!

94
00:06:04,522 --> 00:06:05,622
You thief!

95
00:06:06,122 --> 00:06:07,522
Cameraman!

96
00:06:08,022 --> 00:06:08,922
You thief!

97
00:06:10,822 --> 00:06:12,322
Tinette! Sebastian!

98
00:06:12,322 --> 00:06:13,922
Get out of here!

99
00:06:15,922 --> 00:06:17,222
She has a very soft...

100
00:06:17,278 --> 00:06:19,278
Don't be afraid, Phil.

101
00:06:21,278 --> 00:06:23,278
I've never pet an animal before.

102
00:06:23,278 --> 00:06:25,278
Oh, she's as light as a feather.

103
00:06:25,278 --> 00:06:27,278
She can't move at all.

104
00:06:27,278 --> 00:06:29,278
I almost can't feel her. How cute!

105
00:06:31,278 --> 00:06:33,278
How are you, little cat?

106
00:06:33,278 --> 00:06:35,278
Mrs. Quirter.

107
00:06:35,278 --> 00:06:37,278
I'm going to tell Mrs. Rottenmeier

108
00:06:37,278 --> 00:06:39,278
that she can't take part in dinner

109
00:06:39,278 --> 00:06:41,278
and that she wants to start without you.

110
00:06:41,278 --> 00:06:45,278
And I'm going to take care of the cat.

111
00:06:45,396 --> 00:06:47,396
It's my cat. Did you chase it away?

112
00:06:47,396 --> 00:06:49,396
Order from Mrs. Rottenmeier.

113
00:06:49,396 --> 00:06:51,396
The cat stays. She didn't do anything to anyone.

114
00:06:51,396 --> 00:06:54,396
She's small. Without our help, she can't find anything to eat and is starving.

115
00:06:54,396 --> 00:06:57,396
It can't be changed. Mrs. Rottenmeier wants it.

116
00:07:01,278 --> 00:07:04,278
I know what. We'll just bring her up into the tower room.

117
00:07:04,278 --> 00:07:06,278
She'll never dare to go in front of a rotten man.

118
00:07:06,278 --> 00:07:08,278
Oh, yes, we'll do that. That would be great.

119
00:07:08,278 --> 00:07:10,278
Fantastic. A fantastic...

120
00:07:10,278 --> 00:07:14,278
And you, Sebastian, you'll make a warm place up there so she won't be afraid.

121
00:07:14,278 --> 00:07:16,278
She means... she means...

122
00:07:16,278 --> 00:07:18,278
Oh, please, Sebastian, please.

123
00:07:18,278 --> 00:07:22,278
Well, well, well. If you ask me like that, then I can't help it, can I?

124
00:07:22,278 --> 00:07:24,278
Hooray!

125
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:28,278
I'm relieved too. And you, KÃ¤tzchen, are you happy too?

126
00:07:31,278 --> 00:07:33,022
Yes, I'm happy too.

127
00:07:33,022 --> 00:07:35,022
The air is clean.

128
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:38,022
Be quiet. It will be fine, child.

129
00:07:38,022 --> 00:07:40,022
Hopefully.

130
00:07:52,022 --> 00:07:55,022
We'll take the basket. It will definitely be a good bed.

131
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,700
We just have to put something in it to make it soft.

132
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,700
I've already found something, but we should put it in the room over there.

133
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,700
There it is sunny and better for you.

134
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,700
Oh yes, thank you. Here it is pretty. The sun is shining.

135
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,700
And if she wants, she can see out of the window.

136
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:13,700
Sebastian, I think it's a beautiful room for a cat, isn't it?

137
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,700
Hopefully it's good enough.

138
00:08:16,852 --> 00:08:19,852
But you have a nice bed, my little kitten.

139
00:08:19,852 --> 00:08:21,852
Can you sleep in it?

140
00:08:21,852 --> 00:08:23,852
She stays in it, she seems to like it.

141
00:08:23,852 --> 00:08:25,852
This and that?

142
00:08:25,852 --> 00:08:27,852
We have to give her a name.

143
00:08:27,852 --> 00:08:30,852
Oh, I'm not particularly good at giving names, you know.

144
00:08:30,852 --> 00:08:33,852
But I have a nice name for her.

145
00:08:33,852 --> 00:08:35,852
What do you think, Mau Mau?

146
00:08:37,852 --> 00:08:40,852
Is she sleeping well? Now we have a secret.

147
00:08:40,852 --> 00:08:42,852
Nice. We must not tell anyone.

148
00:08:42,852 --> 00:08:45,748
And especially not in front of the Rottenmeier.

149
00:08:45,748 --> 00:08:49,248
It's your very, very dear cat. Don't you think so, Heidi?

150
00:08:49,248 --> 00:08:51,248
I think so, too.

151
00:09:02,256 --> 00:09:08,256
One moment, I'll be right done.

152
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:11,256
And what can I do for you?

153
00:09:11,256 --> 00:09:13,256
Good morning.

154
00:09:13,256 --> 00:09:15,256
Already on your feet?

155
00:09:15,256 --> 00:09:17,256
Pssst.

156
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:19,256
What is it?

157
00:09:19,256 --> 00:09:21,256
The breakfast for Mau Mau.

158
00:09:21,256 --> 00:09:24,256
Ah, that's what you're worried about, don't worry.

159
00:09:27,856 --> 00:09:31,856
This will taste good for you, and be careful, a rottenmeier.

160
00:09:31,856 --> 00:09:34,856
Wait a moment.

161
00:09:36,856 --> 00:09:38,856
My hat!

162
00:09:38,856 --> 00:09:42,856
No, no, no, my hat is better lifted. You trust me, don't you?

163
00:09:42,856 --> 00:09:45,820
Yes, you are dear, Sebastian.

164
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,820
Mau, Mau?

165
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,820
Mau, Mau!

166
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,820
Mau, Mau!

167
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,820
Mau, Mau!

168
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,820
Mau, Mau, good morning, Mau, Mau.

169
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,820
Mau, Mau!

170
00:10:18,096 --> 00:10:20,096
I asked for your breakfast.

171
00:10:20,096 --> 00:10:22,096
No, no.

172
00:10:28,144 --> 00:10:30,144
Don't you want to get out of there again?

173
00:10:30,144 --> 00:10:31,144
Ah!

174
00:10:31,144 --> 00:10:33,144
You don't do that, Momo!

175
00:10:38,128 --> 00:10:40,828
Your tongue tickles like that of Spendy and Bearly.

176
00:10:40,828 --> 00:10:42,828
But you can't know who that is yet.

177
00:10:50,828 --> 00:10:51,828
That tastes good.

178
00:10:54,328 --> 00:10:55,328
If you eat a lot...

179
00:10:55,344 --> 00:10:57,344
Now you're a big star!

180
00:11:06,448 --> 00:11:09,448
Oh, what did you do to your face?

181
00:11:09,448 --> 00:11:11,448
Oh, that. Maumau scratched me.

182
00:11:11,448 --> 00:11:14,448
That's just a scratch. It doesn't hurt at all.

183
00:11:14,448 --> 00:11:16,448
Oh, Maumau can scratch?

184
00:11:16,448 --> 00:11:19,448
All cats can scratch. That's why they have their claws.

185
00:11:19,448 --> 00:11:21,448
Oh, such a small one?

186
00:11:23,448 --> 00:11:24,448
Mademoiselle Clara!

187
00:11:24,448 --> 00:11:26,448
Oh, there comes Nettie. She mustn't know.

188
00:11:26,448 --> 00:11:28,448
Quickly, take her away!

189
00:11:28,448 --> 00:11:31,448
Maumau! Maumau, come quickly!

190
00:11:31,448 --> 00:11:32,448
This is no game!

191
00:11:32,448 --> 00:11:34,022
Hurry up!

192
00:11:34,022 --> 00:11:50,222
Be a lovely cat and come quickly, Maumau, come! ä¹ä¹ä¹ä¹ä¹ä¹ä¹ä¹ä¹ä¹ä¹ä¹ä¹ä¹ä¹ä¹ä¹ä¹ä¹ä¹ä¹

193
00:11:50,224 --> 00:11:52,224
I'll be back as soon as I can.

194
00:11:59,234 --> 00:12:08,234
Adelheid, in the house of Sesemann it is an unwritten law that you enter the
breakfast room at 8.05 a.m. and not a minute later. Do you understand me?

195
00:12:08,234 --> 00:12:09,234
Yes.

196
00:12:09,234 --> 00:12:14,234
And put your hands on the table as it should be. What did you do to your face,
scratcher?

197
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:22,234
That? I don't know. I fell out of bed this morning and scratched myself.

198
00:12:23,234 --> 00:12:25,234
That doesn't hurt, that heals quickly.

199
00:12:28,792 --> 00:12:31,992
Take your fingers off the wound. Tinette, get something to disinfect.

200
00:12:31,992 --> 00:12:32,992
Yes.

201
00:12:33,992 --> 00:12:36,992
She doesn't need that. A spit is the best thing to do.

202
00:12:36,992 --> 00:12:40,492
Tinette, please do what I've just told you to do.

203
00:12:40,492 --> 00:12:42,492
You'd better take her out with you right away.

204
00:12:42,492 --> 00:12:44,492
Yes, madam. Come on.

205
00:12:46,992 --> 00:12:50,092
And you'd better give her some anti-fever drops right away.

206
00:12:50,092 --> 00:12:52,292
Yes, I'll do that right away, madam.

207
00:12:53,292 --> 00:12:56,792
Are all the children who grew up in the mountains so careless?

208
00:12:56,968 --> 00:12:59,968
What are we going to do with the child?

209
00:13:11,074 --> 00:13:14,074
Yes, I'll be right there.

210
00:13:16,074 --> 00:13:18,074
One moment, I'm coming.

211
00:13:21,074 --> 00:13:24,074
Oh, what do you want here with us?

212
00:13:24,074 --> 00:13:25,074
Good day.

213
00:13:25,074 --> 00:13:28,074
Aha, I understand, but I can tell you that.

214
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:30,074
Bed and rest is forbidden in this house.

215
00:13:30,074 --> 00:13:32,074
So make sure you get out of here, get out of here.

216
00:13:32,074 --> 00:13:34,074
Does a little girl live here?

217
00:13:34,074 --> 00:13:36,074
Two little girls live here.

218
00:13:36,074 --> 00:13:37,074
Is one of the two Heidi?

219
00:13:37,074 --> 00:13:39,074
Has she done something again?

220
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:42,208
So she lives here. I brought her here yesterday.

221
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:45,208
Then you just brought her here. And now watch out that you get away,

222
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,208
otherwise I'll forget and then it'll be terrible.

223
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:51,208
I'll get 20 pfennigs from her. She met me on the street yesterday

224
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:54,208
and promised the money when I showed her a high church tower.

225
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,208
And I did that too.

226
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,208
So, so, 20 pfennigs.

227
00:13:56,208 --> 00:14:00,208
Showing a high tower, met on the street yesterday.

228
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:09,650
Well, then come on in, maybe we can do something for you.

229
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:10,650
Come on, Augustin.

230
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:23,570
Wait here for me and be quiet. I will now call you to Miss Clara.

231
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:28,570
And as soon as I ask you to come in, you start playing the organ, understood?

232
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:32,570
What do you think she will be happy about?

233
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,570
Yes, come in.

234
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:45,160
I regret many times that I have to interrupt the class, but a boy has just come
and wishes to speak to the Blessed Miss.

235
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,160
Oh, I'm getting a visitor. Yes, who is it?

236
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,160
It's a stranger.

237
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,160
Let him come in.

238
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,160
Gladly.

239
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,160
Miss Clara, I have to protest. We can't interrupt the class.

240
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,160
But why not? Now someone has come for the first time and wants to speak to me.

241
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,160
I've never had a visitor before.

242
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,160
Well, but just for a moment. Let him come in, okay?

243
00:15:11,002 --> 00:15:16,002
You may come in now, and don't forget to play on your organ right away.

244
00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:18,002
Come on, Augustin.

245
00:15:32,308 --> 00:15:35,308
What do you mean? Do you want to stop?

246
00:15:35,308 --> 00:15:37,308
But why? It's beautiful!

247
00:15:37,308 --> 00:15:39,308
That should be beautiful? That?

248
00:15:53,308 --> 00:15:56,084
It's nice that you came, little boy.

249
00:15:56,084 --> 00:15:58,084
Oh, you know the boy?

250
00:15:58,084 --> 00:16:00,084
Yes, I met him yesterday in town.

251
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,084
He showed me the way to the church tower.

252
00:16:03,084 --> 00:16:05,084
Do you have time? Can you play something for me?

253
00:16:05,084 --> 00:16:06,084
Yes!

254
00:16:06,084 --> 00:16:07,084
Please play.

255
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,020
Clara, look at his feet!

256
00:16:29,908 --> 00:16:34,908
What music? There's no music on the timetable for today.

257
00:16:34,908 --> 00:16:36,908
And such an ordinary music.

258
00:16:36,908 --> 00:16:38,908
That's what she's up to.

259
00:16:38,908 --> 00:16:42,908
At this point, stop with the noise. Stop that you come out. Leave the house
immediately.

260
00:16:50,908 --> 00:16:53,300
Bring this dragon out of the house immediately.

261
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,300
She's a beautiful girl, don't worry about it.

262
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,300
Ah, Sebastian! Ah, Sebastian!

263
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,300
Get the doctor!

264
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,300
The vet! The chamber hunter!

265
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,300
Ms. Steller, do you have a wish, Mrs. Rottenmeier?

266
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,300
Get rid of this dragon or this...

267
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,700
or whatever it is, out of the house!

268
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,700
As ordered. As Madame wishes.

269
00:17:22,644 --> 00:17:25,644
She could bear that. Well done.

270
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:27,644
I like your instrument.

271
00:17:27,644 --> 00:17:29,644
I still don't have the 20 pfennigs.

272
00:17:29,644 --> 00:17:31,644
Yes, I know. One moment.

273
00:17:31,644 --> 00:17:33,644
Here, 20 pfennigs for yesterday afternoon,

274
00:17:33,644 --> 00:17:35,644
and for today, because it was especially successful,

275
00:17:35,644 --> 00:17:37,644
another 20.

276
00:17:37,644 --> 00:17:39,644
Thank you.

277
00:17:42,324 --> 00:17:47,324
I'm going to put this very unpleasant matter on the ground after the lesson.

278
00:17:49,324 --> 00:17:52,324
Please, Mr. Candidate, don't let it bother you any further.

279
00:17:52,324 --> 00:17:54,324
The Greeks!

280
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,324
Come in!

281
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,300
Strange.

282
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,300
Come in!

283
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:10,300
It's very unpleasant that I have to disturb you, but it's something that was
given to you for Mrs. Clara.

284
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,300
I didn't know what we ordered.

285
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,300
I'll take it.

286
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,300
Open it, Mr. Rottenmeier.

287
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,300
Later, child. After school.

288
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,300
First the work, then the pleasure.

289
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,300
Mr. candidate, please don't stop.

290
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,300
Just a moment.

291
00:18:28,892 --> 00:18:30,892
Don't you want to know?

292
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:31,892
No.

293
00:18:31,892 --> 00:18:33,892
Aren't you curious at all?

294
00:18:33,892 --> 00:18:35,892
Not at all.

295
00:18:35,892 --> 00:18:37,892
I can't understand that.

296
00:18:37,892 --> 00:18:39,892
Mr. candidate, just one look, okay?

297
00:18:39,892 --> 00:18:41,892
That's up to Mrs. Rottenmeier.

298
00:18:41,892 --> 00:18:45,892
Mrs. Rottenmeier, just one look, please.

299
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:47,892
I said no.

300
00:18:47,892 --> 00:18:51,892
But I'm so curious. I can't continue learning if I don't know what's in the
basket.

301
00:18:51,892 --> 00:18:53,892
And Heidi doesn't either.

302
00:18:53,892 --> 00:18:57,892
Well, it looks like we've distracted the children now.

303
00:18:58,028 --> 00:19:02,428
It seems so. We should allow you to take a look inside the basket.

304
00:19:02,428 --> 00:19:04,428
Do you consider this to be acceptable?

305
00:19:04,428 --> 00:19:09,628
What should you do? You would only take part in the class unnoticed anyway.

306
00:19:09,628 --> 00:19:16,428
It's better to allow you a little break. Show them what's in the basket and
you'll see, the work will be a lot more fun afterwards.

307
00:19:16,428 --> 00:19:19,428
To be honest, I'm also curious.

308
00:19:26,854 --> 00:19:30,854
Maybe it's about fresh fruit, and fruit is always good for the brain.

309
00:19:34,854 --> 00:19:37,854
What's the matter with you, Mr. Candidate? Can't you get out of here?

310
00:19:38,854 --> 00:19:41,854
Is your behavior strange?

311
00:19:42,854 --> 00:19:47,854
Hello, Mrs. Rottenmeier. No excitement. Everything is fine. Cuckoo. Cat.

312
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,854
What? Cat? Alive?

313
00:19:51,854 --> 00:19:56,854
Oh, Sebastian! The shovel!

314
00:19:57,854 --> 00:20:00,854
Help! Help me!

315
00:20:01,854 --> 00:20:04,854
Help me, Sebastian!

316
00:20:08,358 --> 00:20:12,358
Did you know that? Of course you knew that!

317
00:20:12,358 --> 00:20:14,358
Give me one!

318
00:20:27,358 --> 00:20:29,358
Leave my feet alone! Let me kiss!

319
00:20:29,358 --> 00:20:31,358
Sebastian! Sebastian!

320
00:20:31,358 --> 00:20:32,358
Don't!

321
00:20:32,358 --> 00:20:34,358
Sebastian!

322
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,358
I'll kill you!

323
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,902
What are you doing on the table?

324
00:20:38,902 --> 00:20:41,902
Get out of the way, you disgusting cats!

325
00:20:41,902 --> 00:20:43,902
Yes, madam.

326
00:20:43,902 --> 00:20:45,902
Come on, you little...

327
00:20:45,902 --> 00:20:47,902
Come on!

328
00:20:47,902 --> 00:20:49,902
Listen to me!

329
00:20:49,902 --> 00:20:51,902
Help me!

330
00:20:52,934 --> 00:20:54,934
Don't be afraid, my little one!

331
00:21:00,152 --> 00:21:02,152
Miss Rottenmeier, you have complaints.

332
00:21:02,152 --> 00:21:04,152
That was probably too much for the poor.

333
00:21:06,152 --> 00:21:08,152
It was never so funny here.

334
00:21:08,152 --> 00:21:11,152
I'm sorry that the cats are now being brought back.

335
00:21:11,152 --> 00:21:12,152
They were so cute.

336
00:21:12,152 --> 00:21:14,152
After the excitement, it's no wonder.

337
00:21:14,152 --> 00:21:16,152
But I would love to know where they come from.

338
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:20,152
Mau Mau, we forgot Mau Mau.

339
00:21:20,152 --> 00:21:21,152
I'll get her.

340
00:21:23,152 --> 00:21:24,152
Yours, Madame.

341
00:21:25,152 --> 00:21:28,152
Oh, this child, this child.

342
00:21:30,152 --> 00:21:30,360
Subtitles by Stephanie Geiges

343
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,360
You should lock her up in the cellar for a whole week.

344
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,360
Lock her up at least one afternoon in the cellar.

345
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,360
Then she'll bring the mice up again.

346
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,360
Oh, they're still there!

347
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,360
Everywhere, I can hear them meowing.

348
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,360
They sit in the corner and laugh at me.

349
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,360
But no, I've taken them all away.

350
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,360
And not forgotten? Not forgotten by any chance?

351
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,360
None.

352
00:21:59,256 --> 00:22:04,256
There she is. She ate well. She ate everything we gave her for breakfast.

353
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:06,256
Give it to me on the lap, Heidi, please.

354
00:22:06,256 --> 00:22:07,256
There!

355
00:22:13,256 --> 00:22:17,256
Mau Mau, do you know what I think? The other cats also came from where you came
from.

356
00:22:17,256 --> 00:22:20,256
So it was Heidi's fault again.

357
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:22,256
Oh, that tickles!

358
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:26,256
Miss Rottenmeier!

359
00:22:26,904 --> 00:22:30,904
What do you think, was it Heidi or was it not?

360
00:22:38,904 --> 00:22:40,904
That was an exciting day for the two of them.

361
00:22:40,904 --> 00:22:45,904
First came the turtledove boy with his turtle and then the many little kittens.

362
00:22:45,904 --> 00:22:49,904
Klara could not remember that she had ever laughed like that before.

363
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:01,800
Heidi and Clara kept their secret that they were hiding in the tower room well.

364
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:06,800
Still, Mrs. Rottenmeier was not able to find out where this quiet moaning came
from that she heard.

365
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:11,800
She still firmly believed that her stressed nerves were giving her the moaning.

366
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,800
And every time she took a headache pill when it meowed.

367
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,800
Of course, Clara and Heidi could laugh about it from the heart.

368
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,800
But then it got dangerous all of a sudden.

369
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,174
Mrs. Rottenmeier discovered something.

370
00:23:24,174 --> 00:23:27,674
But we want to tell you about it in our next story.

371
00:23:28,674 --> 00:23:36,174
Heidi, Heidi, your world are the mountains.

372
00:23:36,674 --> 00:23:44,174
Heidi, Heidi, because up here you are at home.

373
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:50,174
Heidi, Heidi, come home.

374
00:23:50,174 --> 00:23:57,174
Find your happiness, come back home.
